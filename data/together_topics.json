Wir wollten das Thema ansprechen und dir weitere Informationen und Ratschläge geben, um zu vermeiden, dass du ein Betrugsopfer wirst.\n\n## Was ist Phishing? \nPhishing ist eine Art von Betrug, wo der Betrüger Nachrichten (Emails, Texte, Nachrichten über den sozialen Netzwerke) sendet und dabei vorgibt ein bekanntes Unternehmen zu repräsentieren. Er nutzt diese Nachrichten dann, um dir persönliche Daten wie Kennwörter, Kontodetails und Kartennummern zu stehlen.\n\n## Wie benutzen diese Betrüger bunq?\n\nPhishing ist unter unterschiedlichen Formen zu finden. Eine davon wären die SMS Nachrichten oder Emails, die vorgeben von uns zu sein und dir mitteilen, dass etwas mit deinem Konto nicht in Ordnung ist, und du deinen Benutzernamen und dein Kennwort nochmal verifizieren solltest. Alternativ kann es sich auch um eine SMS oder Email von einem Unternehmen handeln, die dir mitteilt dass du noch eine bestimmte “Gebühr” zu bezahlen hast. \n\n## Wie könnte ich es vermeiden Phishing-Opfer zu werden? ‍♂️\n\n- **Gib niemals deine Anmeldedaten oder persönliche Informationen raus**\nBunq würde niemals nach persönlichen Daten außerhalb der App fragen und falls jemand vorgibt wir zu sein und diese Information von dir verlangt, ist es ein Betrug und du solltest auf keinen Fall persönliche Daten rausgeben.\n\n- **Überprüf das Format und Rechtschreibung der Nachrichten** \nFalls das Format und Rechtschreibung zu der geschäftlichen Webadresse, woher es stammen sollte, nicht passt, ist es höchstwahrscheinlich ein Betrug.\n\n- **Pass auf gefälschte Webseiten auf**\nSei immer sicher, dass du auf bunq.app bist, wenn du deine Anmeldedaten eingibst.\n \n- **Nimm Kontakt mit uns via offiziellen Kanäle auf**\nFalls du eine Mail von einer Quelle bekommst, die du erkennst (z.B. bunq ) aber es scheint etwas merkwürdig oder nicht ganz okay zu sein mit der Nachricht, kontaktiere uns nochmal separat, um zu bestätigen, dass die Nachricht authentisch ist. Das hilft uns neue Betrugsmaschen zu identifizieren.\n\n## Sei mit deinen Sozial Media Posts vorsichtig\nWenn du Sachen auf den sozialen Netzwerken teilst, sei mit deinen persönlichen Daten wie Geburtsdatum, Urlaubsplänen, Adresse, Handynummer usw. vorsichtig, da diese Informationen für die Betrüger oft nützlich sein könnten.\n\n## Muss du etwas melden? \nFalls es um einen betrügerischen Benutzer geht, kannst du uns helfen bunq sicher zu halten. Fülle einfach dieses Formular aus und wir übernehmen es von hier an. Falls du einen betrügerischen Benutzer meldest, schließe bitte seine Kontonummer und jegliche relevante Informationen in deiner Nachricht mit ein.\n\n## Was ist zu tun, wenn du einen bunq.me Link nicht vertraust?\nFalls du einen bunq.me Link bekommen hast und Betrug vermutest tippe bitte auf den Report Button, um den Fall bei unserem Compliance Team zu melden. Das Team Ergreift in diesem Fall sofort Maßnahmen\n\n____\n\n## Möchtest du mehr erfahren?\nDu kannst dir gerne unsere bunq Wissensdatenbank unter https://go.bunq.com/link/knowledge anschauen. \n",

How do I unblock my card?\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nAccidentally forgot your PIN and entered the wrong code too many times? \n\nNot to worry as you can reset your PIN via the app! Once you have done so, your card will be unblocked and you can use it again straight away \n\n### What should I do?\n\n[Click here](https://go.bunq.com/link/set-pin) or check out the steps below to choose a new PIN and reactivate your card:\n\n1. **Open** bunq app\n2. Go to **Home** tab\n3. Tap on **Cards**\n4. **Select** the card in question\n5. Tap on **More** and/or select **Change PIN**\n6. Choose a new pin code and **confirm**\n\nAfter completing the steps above, we recommend making an ATM transaction to ensure that the PIN stored on the chip of your card is updated too.\n\n## I entered the PIN correctly but still got an error, what do I do? \n\nBefore using, the PIN needs to have synced to the Card Chip (using in store where you need to enter a PIN and/or ATM withdrawal), otherwise you can get 'Invalid PIN' errors even if the PIN entered is correct. \n\nThis is usually because the terminal is offline and the PIN you've chosen when activating your card isn't on the card chip yet, until an online transaction is completed and we can push the PIN to the card. Therefore the card has a random PIN that was assigned when the card was ordered.\n\n---\n## Do you want to know more about changing your PIN?\nFor additional information please click, [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/60-change-a-cards-pin)\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [How do I change my card's PIN code?](https://together.bunq.com/d/60)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "What is passive income?\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nPassive income is income received on a regular basis, with little or no effort required to maintain it. Rent, interest, royalties or dividends are examples of passive income. Usually this type of income is earned next to the revenues from the main activities of a company, but in some cases the main income source is passive income. If you’re not sure whether your company earns passive income, contact your tax consultant or accountant.\n\n### What does the passive income include?\n\nPassive income includes: interest, rental income, royalties and dividends from third parties (unless the dividends are through management fees, salaries and sales as part of your holding company). Keep in mind that bunq supports 100% passive income!\n\nIf your holding or the company managed by the holding has passive income, you should fill in [this form](https://assets-global.website-files.com/63b43f001c7774d38d5f3a2d/63ed0976de7e35355825d2ca_FATCA_CRS_self-certification_form_.pdf) and provide us with it. \n\n## Did you just get a notification in the app asking for more information?\n\nInformation events are the fastest way to save time when opening a bunq account! They serve as direct options for you to provide documents or information directly to us through your app. \nTo find the events in the app, just follow the steps below:\n\n1. Go to **Profile** tab\n2. Tap on **Events awaiting**\n3. Select **Business information**  and tap on **Awaiting business information**\n\nWhen you get a notification in the app, you can provide the additional information and expected passive income percentage (if you have any) directly to us! \n\n\n## Why did I receive a notification to provide more information? \n\nWe are asking these questions because not all types of business activities are within our acceptance policy and we want to better understand what you are doing. This is in order to prevent possible unwanted restrictions on your account at a later point.

Did you know VAT can be automated at bunq? Yes, VAT is as easy as 1,2,3. Just set up Auto VAT in your bunq app and always know the exact amount of VAT you owe! You can learn how to set up your Auto VAT right away [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/14717). \n\n---\n\n## Keep 30% of your income, for taxes \n\nOf course, income tax obligations differ from business to business. As a freelancer, everything you earn from the services you provide is gross and you must pay income taxes for it. A general way to ensure you have enough money for taxes is to reserve 30% of your business income. With bunq, you can set aside this amount into a separate Bank Account so you have a better overview of your income after tax!\n\n* For our Dutch freelancers \n\nTake advantage of your allowances. Make the most of time spent on your business. Once you work more than 1225 hours in a year  for your company (~24h a week), it's possible to receive a tax allowance of up to 46%! In addition, if your turnover does not exceed €20,000 per year, you are exempt from VAT. You can find more information about these and more allowances [here](https://business.gov.nl/subsidy/entrepreneurs-allowance/)\n\n* For our German freelancers \n\nTake advantage of lower income taxes. Money is an important factor to growing your business. That's why the German government taxes your profits rather than your revenue. You can add up a couple of things as business costs, like rent, internet or travel equipment. The higher your business costs, the lower the net income and tax you will be paying. In addition, if you make less than €22,000 in your first year and less than €50,000 in your second year, you are considered a small business and do not need to charge VAT to your clients! Make sure you keep track of all the receipts with Receipt Scanner and claim your tax deductions effortlessly.\n\n* For our French freelancers \n\nTake advantage of lower social security payments. Running a small business in France has a lot of advantages. One cool benefit is that you're  eligible for a 50% reduction of your social security contributions in the 1st  year of starting your business! Invest this money again on whatever helps your dreams grow. In your second year, you’ll only pay 50% of the CFE tax; and that’s not all - there are many other exemptions you can access. Check the eligibility criteria [here](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F11677#:~:text=Elle%20permet%20aussi%20à%20certains,2020%20ou%20avant%20cette%20date) to see if you qualify. \n\n---\n\nLearn more about our best kept secrets for bookkeeping [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/24610-pro-tips-for-bunq-freelancers-our-best-kept-secrets-for-bookkeeping).\n",

    "source_text" : "German IBANs: Hello Germany!\n\n\n\nHey bunqers \n\nAs we grow across Europe, we’re committed to making life easy , wherever you are. We heard your requests and we worked on them so without further ado, we’re excited to announce that from now on you can have your **own German IBAN**! Yay! For all of our bunqers residing in Germany, this is your call to enjoy a truly local bunq experience! \n\n### What's a German IBAN? \n\nAs we all know, bunq is a European bank based in the Netherlands meaning that your IBANs are located in the Netherlands. You can recognize this when you see the NL in your IBANs.  If you’re a bunqer-to-be, all your IBANs since the opening of your new bunq account will have a German IBAN - provided you’re a German resident. \n\nThis is a huge milestone for all of us!  We’ll keep working on more internalization so that we can empower you to be free everywhere you go or anywhere you are.  \n\n---\n\n## Cool! How can I get a German IBAN?\n\nYou can get your brand new German IBAN by following these easy steps:\n\n1. Go to **Home** tab \n2. Tap on  **+ Add**\n3. Click on  Add a Bank Account\n4. Select  Bank Account\n5. Personalize your Bank Account\n6. Choose Local IBAN (German)\n7. Done \n\n**If you’re a bunqer-to-be residing in Germany **\n\n1. Go through the verification process explained [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/24112-how-do-i-complete-my-identity-verification)\n2. Go with the verification flow ✅\n\nYou can check which identity documents we currently accept [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/3355) \n\nAnd the coolest part about this - the German IBANs are available for all the plans we offer! (including Easy Bank, Easy Money, Easy Green and Pack)\n\n**If you want a joint account ‍**\n\nIn this case, only the creator of the account must verify their as it’s explained [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/24112-how-do-i-complete-my-identity-verification).\n\n---\n\n## But I have Dutch IBANs and now I want a German one, what do I do? \nFollow and trust the process, you’ll be able to get your German IBAN even if you had Dutch IBANs before that. Just keep in mind that **if you choose to go for a German IBAN all your new Bank Accounts will receive German IBANs automatically**. And your Dutch IBANs? You’re free to keep and use them as usual! \n\n---\n\n## And what if I am already verified and want to stay with my Dutch IBANs?\nOur top priority is to give you freedom, meaning that if you are a German user with a verified bunq account and Dutch IBANs, you can decide to keep your Dutch IBANs. When you choose this, all your new Bank Accounts will receive Dutch IBANs automatically as before. However, if you change your mind later, worry not - you can always choose to get German IBANs via your address settings (once available for already verified users). Bear in mind that this option is not available the other way around. Once you opt for getting German IBANs, you can no longer change the IBAN country as you reside in Germany. You can still keep your old Dutch IBANs unchanged. \nYou can see how to do it [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/2546).\n\n---\n\n## What if I'm not a German resident but I still want a German IBAN? \nNo need to worry - Local IBANs are here, and they’re the perfect fit for your international lifestyle. Easily add and use IBANs from multiple European countries - all in your bunq app. Easy Money and Easy Green Personal and Business users can start exploring this feature. You can learn more about this [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/45253)  \n\n---\n\n## German Switch Service\n\nGot your German IBAN and want to make bunq your primary bank account? You can do so via the fully mobile Bank Switch Service within the app! You can learn how to activate your German Switch Service [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/15793)  \n\n___\n\n## Does bunq offer P-Konto?\n\nEven though we support German IBANs, our banking license is from the Netherlands so we do not currently offer P-Konto. We are legally required to follow instructions from authorities if it concerns a garnishment or account seizure. You can learn more regarding this [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/38058)\n\n---\n\n## Do you report to Schufa\n\nThe short answer is no, we don’t.\n\nTo give you the freedom to use your account on your terms, we ensure that you can't fall into debt by not offering loans or overdraft. This way you can freely use your money without the burden of debt. You can learn more about this [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/46809).\n\n---\n\n## What's the difference between Local IBAN and Local Currency? \n\nLearn more [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/48910)\n\n___\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [Local IBANs ](https://together.bunq.com/d/45253-local-ibans)\n- [What's the difference between Local IBAN and Local Currency?](https://together.bunq.com/d/48910-whats-the-difference-between-local-iban-and-local-currency)\n\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "What is SOFORT?\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nSOFORT is an Online Banking ePayment method, not unlike iDEAL. Where iDEAL is reserved for Dutch bank account owners, SOFORT is available for users who have a bank account in other European countries. \n\n### In which countries is SOFORT available?\n\n- Austria\n- Belgium\n- Germany\n- Italy\n- Netherlands\n- Spain\n\n## When can SOFORT deposits be used?\n\n- As an alternative to iDEAL for topping up your balance\n- To pay bunq.me requests \n\n*Small note: The minimum amount of cash you can deposit with SOFORT is €0,10. All transactions that are lower will be refused by SOFORT.*\n\n## What is the daily limit for SOFORT transfer?\n\n- bunq Personal: €250 in total\n- bunq Business: €500 in total \n\n---\n\nBecause of extra risks involved, bunq.me payments with SOFORT are not instantly transferred to the receiving bunq account. The payment comes in as soon as we receive it from SOFORT with a normal SCT cycle. A SOFORT deposit to top up your own bunq account will be available for you instantly! \n\nLooking to pay with SOFORT in a web shop? Check out [this link](https://together.bunq.com/d/5676-how-do-i-pay-with-sofort-in-a-web-shop) to see how.\n\n**Update: We've blocked SOFORT deposits coming in from Keytrade, KBC (Belgium), HypoVereinsbank (Germany), Deutsche Bank (Spain) and Banca Sella (Italy) because they were not providing the name of the accountholder with the transfer. Please note some N26 users experience difficulties regularly trying to top up via SOFORT. To avoid unnecessary waiting time, we recommend you to transfer from your N26 to your bunq account using a regular SEPA transfer.**\n\n---\n\n## Good to know\n\n- If you've a 'pending' Sofort transaction still open, this one also counts towards your daily Sofort limit as it might still get completed \n- If you receive an error message \"Transaction not allowed\", the request expires almost immediately. We'd suggest using a different payment method to complete the payment, for example via a regular bank transfer\n- Not completed attempts to top up with Sofort expire after 30 minutes\n- We give you the money from the Sofort top-up payments right away and then we receive the money from the other bank later. Once received we reset the Sofort limit. It takes 2 business days for the limit to be reset and only then you can use Sofort to top-up again\n- All incoming Sofort transactions contribute to the limit\n- When you create a bunq.me request and the other party settles the request using Sofort, this counts towards your full limit of €250.00 (eg. request for €10 settled with Sofort will allow the user to only top-up with €240.00 or less)\n- This limit can also result in a request not being payable with Sofort. \neg. You create a Shared Request for €10.00 and send it to a group of friends. You then top-up your account with €250.00 using Sofort. Your friends will get an error when they try to settle the request using Sofort (Sofort not available for this request). If they try again the next day, they'll be able to settle the request using Sofort again.\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [How do I top up my account with iDEAL or SOFORT?](https://together.bunq.com/d/50061)\n- [What is the limit for a Sofort top up?](https://together.bunq.com/d/20376)\n\nWant to learn more?

Confirm and set! \n\n## How does it work? \n\nThis second PIN will be linked to a Secondary Bank Account, meaning that you can use your card's regular PIN to pay for groceries from your household account, and your second PIN to pay for drinks during a night out using your weekend activities account. \n\nJust use the PIN of the account you wish to use and that's the one you'll pay with  \n\nKeep in mind that Secondary PIN uses an online PIN as a cardholder verification method. Thus, it won't work with merchants who accept only offline PIN verification methods, as is often the case in France.\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [How to order a new card?](https://together.bunq.com/d/2936)\n- [How can I order a Metal Card?](https://together.bunq.com/d/23424)\n- [bunq Credit Card FAQs](https://together.bunq.com/d/12958)\n\nExplore more bunq knowledge [here](https://go.bunq.com/link/knowledge) 濾\n\n\n",

    "source_text" : "What's the difference between Local IBAN and Local Currency?\n\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nIn order to get the full local experience, we've launched Local IBANs and Local Currencies. However both features have a different way to improve your local experience, bare with us to see how.\n\n### What is the difference?\n\n#### Local IBANs\n\nLocal IBANs are IBANs based on the local Dutch, German, French and Spanish banking metrics and operate in Euro. This means that you open a Bank Account with one of our local branches and your IBAN matches the nationality you've chosen. You can see more on how the Local IBANs work [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/45253).\n\n**Important note:** All the Bank Accounts you open within the app, no matter of the country code in the IBAN, are supported and opened by bunq NL. \n\n#### Local Currencies\n\nLocal Currencies is a feature which gives you the opportunity to send, receive and pay in one of the many local currencies we currently provide. For example, you can have a South African Rand local currency account, but not a South African IBAN. When you open a Local Currencies Bank Account, you're getting a GB IBAN since the foreign currency isn't held in the Netherlands, but in the UK. You can learn all about operating with this cool feature [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/45414).\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [Local Currencies ](https://together.bunq.com/d/45414)\n- [Local IBANs ](https://together.bunq.com/d/45253)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "What are SEPA Business to Business (B2B) Direct Debits and how do I accept them?\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nIn the world of banking and finance, SEPA Business to Business (B2B) Direct Debits play a crucial role in facilitating transactions between businesses. But what exactly are they, and how can you, as a bunq user, accept them? This topic will provide a comprehensive overview of SEPA B2B Direct Debits, explaining their purpose, how they function, and the steps you need to follow to accept them through your bunq account.\n\n### How do I accept SEPA B2B Direct Debits?\n\nNormally, accepting a business to business direct debit requires you to send a signed form to your bank and, after acceptance, it cannot be easily changed. We decided to do this differently- when another company sends a mandate form you can simply write down your bunq IBAN and send it back to them, no need to send us a copy \n\nWhen the company then gives the form to their bank, they will send the first direct debit. You will see this as an event in the app, which you can accept or decline. It's that easy \n\nUpon accepting the mandate you’ll accept all future direct debits from that party and the limit is automatically set based on the original amount. You can always change the limit of both the mandate and your bank account at any time.\n\n## How does it work in the app?\n\nHere's how it works in the app:\n\n1. Home\n2. Tap on Events\n3. Select the awaiting event\n4. You can choose between Always accepting this Direct debit or to Accept only this direct debit\n5. Enter your security code\n6. Done  \n\n*You have **1 day (24 hours)** to accept it before it expires and is automatically declined.*\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [How do I auto-accept direct debits?](https://together.bunq.com/d/49548)\n- [How can I pay direct debits with bunq?](https://together.bunq.com/d/1972)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : " Utiliser bunq en France\n\n\n\nbunq est disponible dans tous les pays membres de l’espace économique européen (EEE) ce qui en fait une banque internationale. Cependant, tous les pays n'ont pas les mêmes habitudes bancaires. C’est pourquoi nous aimerions partager quelques conseils avec nos utilisateurs vivant en France, un pays plein de culture, de beaux paysages et de nourriture incroyable.  縷\n\n---\n\n## Connaître votre IBAN\nEn frayant notre chemin dans l’océan de banques traditionnelles, nous avons eu la chance d'acquérir un permis bancaire: un permis bancaire néerlandais, pour être précis. Cela signifie que lorsque vous ouvrez un compte chez bunq, ce dernier aura un IBAN néerlandais qui est tout à fait approprié pour être utilisé dans tout l'EEE (Espace économique européen). Alors ne vous inquiétez pas, vous pouvez très bien payer vos factures avec votre compte bunq.\n\nExample d’IBAN bunq: NLXXBUNQXXXXXXXXXX\n\nSi vous vous retrouvez dans une situation où votre IBAN est rejeté en raison de sa provenance néerlandaise, vérifiez s'il s’agit d’une [discrimination d’IBAN](https://together.bunq.com/d/23003)\n\n---\n\n## RIB? J’aime seulement les “ribs” en barbecue 肋\nRIB est l'abréviation de relevé d’identité bancaire. Certaines entités peuvent vous demander de fournir un RIB pour prouver la propriété de votre IBAN. Pour vous assurer que votre compte bunq peut être utilisé sans aucune limitation, nous avons introduit une fonctionnalité qui vous permet de l’obtenir en quelques secondes. Il vous faut simplement changer  la langue de votre appareil mobile en français et suivre les étapes présentées [ici](https://together.bunq.com/d/5375).\n\n---\n\n## Chèques\nEn tant que banque en ligne, bunq n'a pas de divisions locales. Cela signifie que les méthodes disponibles pour déposer votre argent sur un compte bunq sont entièrement numérisées. Actuellement, nos utilisateurs se servent principalement de Klarna (SOFORT), iDeal, virements bancaires ou cartes de crédit / débit pour recharger leurs comptes, bien que certains d'entre eux préfèrent encore un chèque physique. Notre application ne prend cependant en charges que des méthodes entièrement automatisées et éco-friendly. Moins de chèques, moins de papier, moins d'arbres endommagés.  \nSi vous avez un chèque qui doit être encaissé, nous vous conseillons de rechercher si une entreprise locale tierce permet de transférer le montant du chèque en question aux détails de l'IBAN.\n\n---\n\n## Numéro fiscal\nEn tant que banque, nous sommes dans l’obligation légale d’effectuer quelques contrôles lors du processus d’inscription. Nous devons par exemple vous demander de fournir votre NIF (Numéro d'identification fiscale). Pour aider nos utilisateurs expatriés et mineurs, nous accordons cependant une période de 3 mois pour le transmettre! Si vous créez un compte pour votre enfant, le NIF de votre enfant peut être connecté au vôtre jusqu'à ce qu'il devienne majeur.\n\n---\n\n**Conseil supplémentaire**: C’est la période en France durant laquelle nos utilisateurs en France commencent à déclarer leurs impôts.  [Sur cette page](https://together.bunq.com/d/28569) vous trouverez plus d’informations à ce sujet. \n\n---\n\n## Vous voulez en savoir plus ?\n\nConsultez [cette page](https://together.bunq.com/t/france) \n\n",

As always, we're here to make your banking experience as clear and straightforward as possible \n\n### What does this status mean?\n\n- **For outgoing card payments**\n\nFor outgoing card payments, this status means that the funds have left your account successfully, however the merchant has failed to collect the payment from your account within 30 days. This means that the funds will be returned to your account. \n\nIn the Bank Account’s payment history you can see both statuses of the expired payment - when it left your account successfully and when it was returned to you. \n\n- **For incoming card refunds**\n\nFor incoming card refunds, this status means that the merchant has initiated a refund to your bank account. However, the merchant failed to send the funds and complete the refund within 30 days. Therefore the payment status changes to “Expired”. \n\nIn the Bank Account’s payment history you can see both statuses of the expired refund - when it was initially requested by the merchant and when it expires.\n\n## You’ll see this description in the payment event\n\nAlthough the merchant indicated a refund, we never received the money from them. Please contact them for further information.\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [How do I solve a failed card payment?](https://together.bunq.com/d/24142)\n- [Issue with card payments](https://together.bunq.com/d/48481)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "How do I solve a failed contactless payment?\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nWe understand that experiencing a failed contactless payment can be frustrating. In this topic, we'll list various scenarios, from daily limits to card activation issues, and providing step-by-step solutions to get you back to effortless banking. \n\n### Exceeded daily limit \nTo protect your cards, we've set daily limits for contactless payments of €50 per transaction and €150 for cumulative transactions (when this amount is reached or after 5 contactless payments, you just need to insert your card into the terminal and enter your PIN and the daily counter will reset. When a [country is enabled](https://together.bunq.com/d/2815-can-i-use-my-bunq-card-in-foreign-countries/9) in your card settings, the [local contactless limit](https://together.bunq.com/d/17570-travel-with-ease-contactless-limits-improvements) will apply)\n\nYou can find more information about daily limits on this [link](https://together.bunq.com/d/6635)\n\n### We need a PIN for this payment \nIf your contactless payment gets declined and you get the error message”PIN not received”, this means we'll need your PIN code for this transaction. Please try to pay by inserting your card in the terminal.\n\n### Card isn't active \nIn order to be approved, card payments must be done with an active card. This means that if you've just ordered you card and didn't activate it yet or if you card is temporarily frozen, the payment won't go through. In these cases, you should first [activate your card](https://together.bunq.com/d/3985) before you try to pay again. \n\n### Will there be an error shown on the POS terminal? ❌\n\nWhen you pay on a POS terminal, errors with different messages can appear on it if the payment fails. Some of them will state the exact reason why this card payment has failed and others will show a different type of error. This might be caused by the card not being accepted by the terminal so we suggest trying another card of yours or try paying with your Google or Apple Pay.\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [What are the limits for contactless payments?](https://together.bunq.com/d/27058-what-are-the-limits-for-contactless-payments)\n- [How do I activate and deactivate my card?](https://together.bunq.com/d/3985-how-do-i-activate-and-deactivate-my-card)\n",

    "source_text" : "bunq Tips - Find out how you can save money in a fun and easy way!\n\nHi there!\n\nMaybe you're still dreaming of that holiday, that car and that new mobile phone, but you can’t resist the temptation when your friends ask you to go out for a beer? Or maybe you ordered too much food at home and you need to grab funds from your savings again in order to make it to the end of the month - we’ve all been there. \n\nLet us help you save more money! How? Create a Savings Goal in the bunq app! You can even save for something together with somebody else by creating a Joint Savings Goal in just a few seconds. \n\n## Savings Account\n\nIt's super sweet and easy to use. Still haven't opened your Savings Account? Follow the steps mentioned [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/5142).\n\nEach time you deposit money into your Savings Account, you'll see the progress for reaching your goal as a percentage. This helps you stay the course and encourage you to keep saving. You also have the possibility to adjust the goal whenever you feel like it, by going to the **Settings** of your Savings Goal.\n\nTo keep you from using money from your Savings Goal for other purposes, you’re only able [to withdraw your funds 2 times per month](https://together.bunq.com/d/5147). We want you to reach your goals, as fast as possible! \n\n## Joint Savings Account\n\nEasy right? You can also open a [Joint Savings Account](https://together.bunq.com/d/8482), which allows you to invite family members, friends and partners to save money with you if they have a bunq account as well. Something to keep in mind is that inviting additional members to the sub-account isn't possible after its creation. It has to be done during the setup.\n\n**Note**: Your Savings Goal comes with its own IBAN and making transfers to that IBAN is possible!\n\n## Auto Save\n\nApart from helping you stay the course, we also make it easy for you to save money: with [Auto Save](https://together.bunq.com/d/5148) you get to save money without having to think about it. This particular savings method will round each payment to the next multiple of €1, €2, or €5 you make and save the difference! It'll be deposited automagically to your Savings Goal. It can be enabled either when you create your Savings Goal, or simply by going to its **Settings**.\n\n#### How does it work?\n\n- **Round up to €1**\n  - You make a payment of €3.50 > Save €0.50\n- **Round up to €2**\n  - Payment of €16.00 > Save €2.00\n  - Payment of €11.00 > Save €1.00\n- **Round up to €5**\n  - Payment of €10.00 > Save €5.00\n  - Payment of €12.00 > Save €3.00\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [What's a Savings Account and how do I create one?](https://together.bunq.com/d/5142)\n- [How do I withdraw money from my Savings Account?](https://together.bunq.com/d/5147)\n- [How do I enable AutoSave for my Savings Account?](https://together.bunq.com/d/5148)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "How does Finn safeguard my privacy?\n\nHey bunqers \n\nAt bunq, your privacy is sacred. As a bank, we deal with our users’ most trusted and private data, which is why we maintain the strictest privacy standards. Finn is no exception: as your personal AI money assistant, it will only use your data for your benefit. \n\nIn this topic, you can learn more about how specifically Finn uses your data and how bunq makes it impossible to jeopardize the sanctity of your private data. \n\n### How does Finn use my data?\n\nFinn is designed with a focus on personalized and secure data management. Each data type (transactions, activities, etc) has a separate database where each user's data is stored by us. When you ask Finn a question, it retrieves data from this database in a secure way, ensuring no user’s data gets leaked. \n\nFinn is specifically engineered to access and utilize this individual database, ensuring a customized and private experience for each user. This means that Finn's interactions and assistance are tailored to the specific needs and data of the individual user, enhancing the user experience while maintaining a high level of data security \n\n## Does Finn save my data?\n\nFinn doesn’t train on, memorize, or use your data outside the conversations you’ve had with it. In the tech world, it’s called “amnesic”: every time you start a new conversation, Finn starts each conversation with a clean slate, retrieving only the necessary data to provide you with the best possible support. A temporary overview of your data is created to provide you with an answer. This snapshot is created at the moment you initiate the conversation and **won’t be used later for any other purposes**. \n\nIf you choose to proceed with the same chat you've previously engaged with, a portion of the chat's history will be passed. This allows Finn to continue the conversation.\n\n* Further information can be found in our [Personal](https://www.bunq.com/documents/personal) and [Business](https://www.bunq.com/documents/business) Terms & Conditions.\n\n## Where is my data stored?\n\nYour data never leaves our perimeters. We also comply with all applicable regulations when it comes to data protection within Europe (eg. GDPR). Partnering with AWS, ChatGPT from Azure and Google on the latest AI technology, we provide an individual and private model with top security and privacy, meaning that it runs only on our infrastructure in our cloud environment. Additionally, your data is retained for a temporary period of 30 days for the purpose of monitoring any misuse.\n\nNo personal data will be used, for purposes other than monitoring misuse, by any third party or individuals.\n\n## Does my data go to third parties like ChatGPT or Gemini?\n\nThe data related to your question is processed using models in collaboration with our partners AWS, ChatGPT from Azure, and Google. However, it's important to note that these partners only process the data we send to them. They do not permanently store it and will not use it for their own training purposes. Furthermore, all data processing activities are carried out within the European Union and therefore protected by GDPR.\n\n## Is there any question Finn can’t answer?\n\nFinn won’t respond to any questions about other users, subjects not related to banking, or any language that promotes violence, self-harm, or unfairness. It’s built to maintain a professional manner at all times.\n\n## Can other users access my data?\n\nNo. Finn only uses your own data to answer your questions and can’t use it to answer other users’ inquiries. \n\n## Does Finn provide accurate information?\n\nFinn strives to provide you with the most accurate information possible.  Finn is in its Beta version, meaning it’s continually improving thanks to human input. By using Finn and leaving a thumbs up or thumbs down to each of Finn’s answers, you help Finn improve. \n\nAs any new generative AI technology, Finn can sometimes provide unexpected or inaccurate answers. While the likelihood of errors is low, the potential for diverse and unexpected responses is higher.\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [Meet Finn, your personal money assistant 烙](https://together.bunq.com/d/58470)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "What is bunq's BIC/SWIFT code?\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nAt bunq we believe that transferring money should be easy, which is why we do this via a text message or mail.  \n\nSometimes you still need to transfer money from an international account to a bunq account. In that case you'll need a BIC or Bank Identifier Code. \n\nThis is also referred to as a SWIFT code. With the BIC code, a bank outside of the SEPA region can identify that you're trying to make an international transfer to a bunq account. \n\nThe BIC/SWIFT code for our IBANs are as follows:\n\n- **NL  IBANs = BUNQNL2AXXX**\n- **DE  IBANs = BUNQDE82XXX**\n- **FR  IBANs = BUNQFRP2XXX**\n- **ES  IBANs = BUNQESM2XXX**\n- **IE   IBANs = BUNQIE22XXX**\n- **UK   IBANs = TCCLGB31XXX**\n\n## What's a BIC/SWIFT code?\n\nThe SWIFT system is used to standardize international banking transactions through IBAN. Banks often use the bank identifier code (BIC) instead of the SWIFT code, however, the two are easily interchangeable. \n\nA BIC/SWIFT code is often needed when sending international transfers. You can find out more about them [here](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100214/whats-difference-between-iban-and-swift-code.asp).\n\n## Where can I find bunq's BIC/SWIFT code?\n\nYou can also conveniently locate our BIC/SWIFT code directly from your Accounts screen if you ever forget it!

With the European Central Bank’s recent rate hikes, we continue to increase our interest rates too.\n\n## Why is MassInterest raised in the Netherlands?\n\nThe decision to raise interest rates for Personal and Business Savings Accounts is influenced by various factors, like market conditions for example.

Further information can be found [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/57095).\n\n## Why do MassInterest rates vary in different countries?\n\nWe strive to offer our users a competitive interest in all countries where we operate. Each country however has its own set of rules, regulations and market conditions which result in different interest rates across Europe. The country where you are resident determines which of bunq's rates applies to you.\n\n## How can I set up my dedicated Savings Account to receive MassInterest?\n\nIf you don’t have a Savings Account yet, simply follow the steps below:\n\n1.

    "source_text" : "Legal guardianship - what is it and how does it work \n\nHey bunqers \n\nIn case you’ve been put under guardianship, this topic will provide you with all the information you need regarding the whole process and how this affects your bunq account.\n\nBe informed that as of 28th December, 2021 we paused the opening of new accounts for people under legal guardianship. If you already have an existing account with us that you activated before the indicated date, this change won’t affect you in any way!\n\n### What's legal guardianship?\n\nA legal guardianship is a measure ruled by court to protect you and your finances. Individuals who may struggle with managing their finances or making reasonable decisions can be assigned a legal guardian. This guardian steps in to help them handle these matters. So let’s see what happens next.\n\nFrom the moment a court decision for guardianship has been ruled on, you're put under administration and are assigned a public registration.\n\n## How does this affect my bunq account?\n\n#### Step 1. We’ll let you know\n\nWhen we’re contacted by a legal guardian and receive all the necessary documentation (including the court decision)  from them, we put the relevant account under legal guardianship and inform you right away in the app.\n\nTo check your received messages from bunq you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to Profile\n2. Click on “See More” under Activity\n3. Check out the messages sent there\n\n#### Step 2. Debt collection\n\nWhen we receive a document to block your account(s) because you were declared under legal guardianship by the relevant court, we will block all your liable monetary accounts. The accounts remain blocked until we receive a signed request by the legal guardian appointed by the court to unblock one particular monetary account or all of your monetary accounts.\n\nWe comply with a variety of requests which the legal guardian may have keeping in mind the limitations of the applicable law.\n\nIf or when the legal guardian requests all available funds in your liable monetary accounts, we’ll transfer these amounts to the dedicated bank account provided by them.\n\n#### Step 3. Unblocking your account\n\nThere are two ways to get your account unblocked and released from the guardianship.\n1. A court order from the same court that made the initial decision that declares that the legal guardianship has ended. \n2. Your curator can contact us with a request to end the legal guardianship on your account by providing us with the court order.\n\nIf your account was requested to be permanently terminated by your legal guardian, we will have to comply with their order as they have the legal rights to do so. .\n\n## When will my account be unblocked?\n\nThis depends on the instructions of the legal guardian. To have your account unblocked, please contact your legal guardian.\n\n## My account was blocked on request of my legal guardian. How can I reactivate it?\n\nIn this case, your legal guardian asked us to block (or close) your account. If you want to have access to your account again, you have to discuss this with your legal guardian.\n\nIf you and your guardian reach an agreement, your legal guardian can reach out to us with the two documents:\n\n- The courter order\n- [A filled in Administrator Consent form](http://bunq.com/consent-form-administrator)\n\n## I have another question about legal guardianship. Who do I contact?\n\nWe've shared the available details about the guardianship. For more specific advice and assistance, it would be best to contact your respective legal guardian. They'll be able to provide you with more detailed information.\n\n## When will my legal guardianship end?\n\nAs soon as a judge ruled on the termination of your legal guardianship. When that happens we must receive the verdict.\n\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [Can I open a bunq account while under legal guardianship?](https://together.bunq.com/d/49747)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "bunq Credit Card FAQs\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nLooking forward to trying out your new bunq Credit Card but have some questions about how it works? Check out a list of some frequently asked questions below:\n\n### Is the bunq Credit Card a credit card?\n\nYes, it's an official credit card, but of course, we made a card that works for you as it comes without the risk of falling into debt. This allows you to use it to the full extent and acceptability of a normal credit card, without the possibility of financial burden.\n\n## What’s the difference between the bunq Credit Card and the Debit Card (Mastercard)?\n\nThe bunq Credit Card will be the best card option for worldwide traveling. With it, you get the overall usability of a credit card without the risk that comes along with credit.\n\nYou can use it when traveling for hotel reservations, car rentals and all other payments that require a deposit. This means larger merchant acceptance and more convenience on your holiday. The main difference is that it'll be accepted by merchants who only accept credit cards.\n\nHotels and car rentals have had issues accepting our Debit Card (Mastercard) because they require a deposit and they'll only accept a credit card. This was then resolved with the Credit Card. More information on page 25 of [this document]( https://www.bunq.com/en/terms-personal).\n\n## How does the bunq Credit Card work with deposits?\n\nIf you want to use your bunq Credit Card for a deposit, such as for a rental car or hotel room, the merchant will accept your card just like they would a traditional credit card. Since no credit is used when making the payment, the entire retainer of the deposit will be deducted directly from your account at the time of purchase.\n\nThis means you need to have the available funds in your account when paying the deposit. Once the deposit is released, you'll then receive the funds back in your account and you won't risk having a negative balance or falling into debt.\n\n## Can I use Apple Pay/Google Pay with the bunq Credit Card?\n\n[Apple Pay](https://together.bunq.com/d/521-apple-pay) and [Google Pay](https://together.bunq.com/d/8480-what-is-google-pay-and-how-do-i-enable-it/2) are available with your Credit Card, see our announcement topic [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/20621-update-now-use-apple-or-google-pay-with-your-bunq-travel-card/5).  \n\n## How can I top up the bunq Credit Card?\n\nWe offer multiple ways (free of charge) of topping up your card, our most recent is the [Credit or Debit Card top up](https://together.bunq.com/d/13577-top-up-with-a-credit-debit-card) (with a small service fee) but you can discover the rest of them if you follow the link [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/2933-how-do-i-deposit-money-or-transfer-funds-to-my-bunq-account). \n\n## Can I use the Credit Card for offline payments?\n\nYes, you can use the Credit Card for offline payments up to €250. You can find the FAQ for offline payments [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/4822-offline-pin-payments-faq)\n\n## Does the BIN of the Credit Card match with the country I live in?\n\nThe Credit Card will be issued with a specific country BIN for all users who get their card delivered in Germany, France, Italy, Ireland, Belgium, Greece, Austria, Portugal and the Netherlands. For bunqers who live in another country, they'll get a card with a Dutch BIN. \n\n## Is my bunq Credit Card accepted in the Netherlands?\n\nKeep in mind that credit cards aren’t accepted everywhere in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Most stores don’t support credit card payments. However, you can still use your Debit Card (Mastercard) due to the [recent changes](https://together.bunq.com/d/55260) made by Mastercard. \n\n## Does the bunq Credit Card look slightly different?\n\nYes, it does! We gave the best card to travel the world with a shiny, new look. With a reflective finish and slightly darker undertones, the chrome rainbow will be sure to get noticed on all your travels.\n\n## Will my Credit Card payments show on the export statement?\n\nAbsolutely! The paid amount will be deducted from your account immediately, therefore the statement will show the payment right away. The difference between this and a Debit Card (Maestro) payment is that the date of settlement will be set to the first of the next month.\n\n**Example:** If you make a Credit Card payment on the 14th of April, the settlement date will be set to the 1st of May. The export statement will show 2 dates - the date the payment is made and the\nsettlement date.\n\n## Do I get any benefits as a Credit Card holder?\n\nIndeed you do! \n\na) Dutch Personal users who are Credit Card holders can connect their Credit Card to their Air Miles account.;\nb) For every €5.00 a Dutch user spends abroad, they get 1 Air Mile added to their account if the card is linked;\nc) You can connect the card yourself through the web interface of Air Miles to be eligible;\nd) Air Miles can be spent in a lot of shops for discounts - for example: Albert Heijn and Shell. \n\n_____\n\n## How does paying for the bunq Credit Card work?\n\nCredit card is one of the cards included on the Easy Money, Easy Green or Easy Bank plans. \n\n## What app features are included when purchasing only a bunq Credit Card?\n\nWhen you pay for a bunq Credit Card you'll receive a Mastercard credit card, Zero FX, instant push notifications, ability to request/split a payment, ability to accept requests, card freezing and limit setting and the option to accept a director invite.\n\n☝️ Keep in mind that you need to order and activate your Credit Card in order to fully use your bunq account. You can see how to order your Credit Card [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/22397-how-can-i-order-a-travel-card), and how to activate your card [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/3985-how-do-i-activate-and-deactivate-my-card).\n\n\n## Are there any extra costs?\n\nThe costs for cash withdrawals and top-ups are invoiced on your billing day. You can see more [here](https://go.bunq.com/link/billing/runningcosts).\n\nWhen you order a replacement for a lost or stolen card, there's a €9.99 fee to help us cover the production costs for your new card.\n\nYou can check out our full pricing overview [here](https://www.bunq.com/en/pricing-sheet).\n\n____\n\n### Getting a Credit Card with an Easy Money, Easy Green or Easy Bank plan\n\n## What if I’m an Easy Money or Easy Green user and I already have 3 cards? Will I need to pay for the bunq Credit Card? \n\nIt'll apply to the 3 cards (previously ordered) count included in your Personal and Business plans.\n\nIf you already have 3 cards as a [Personal](https://www.bunq.com/personal) or [Business](v) member, you'll then need to pay a one-time fee of €9.99 for production costs (keep in mind that this 3 card count includes cards that have been previously canceled). Then when you activate the card, you'll be charged an extra €3.49 per month on top of the monthly fee. If you block or freeze one of the cards, so that you have only 3 active cards in total, then you'll not be charged the €3,49 monthly cost.\n\nIf you have less than 3 cards, then you can order the bunq Credit Card for no extra costs.\n\n## How do I order the bunq Credit Card?\n\nThe bunq Credit Card will be available to [order](https://together.bunq.com/d/2936-how-can-i-order-a-card) in the Cards tab of the app, the same way as all previous cards.\n\n## What are the steps for replacing your current Mastercard for your bunq Credit Card?\n\nAs you can't replace your Mastercard directly through your app, the best is to [order](https://together.bunq.com/d/2936-how-can-i-order-a-card) a new card. ☝️Remember that if you already have 3 active cards. Freeze first as much as necessary if you don't want to be charged for going over the limit of active cards on your plan. The replacing option on the bunq app won't offer you the swap to Mastercard.\n\n## Good to Know\n\n- You can see the balance of your card in the card’s overview page. Simply go to your Home tab > click on “Cards” > select the card you want > the balance will appear in the middle circle on the card’s tab\n\n- If you’ve ordered 3 physical cards in the past, 1 of which was replaced, you may be wrongly charged when ordering the Credit Card. In such cases, make sure to contact our support team and ask for a refund \n\n- When you make withdrawals you can get billed by bunq as per our [Pricing sheet](https://www.bunq.com/en/pricing-sheet) for this service. The fee will be applied to your monthly invoice.\n\n- You can use your Credit Card to make payments through Wise\n\n- When you order a card and need to add money to the Bank Account because of insufficient balance, the option for bank transfer won't appear because the payment won’t be instant and you can’t order the card right away. When you’ve already ordered the card, the option for bank\ntransfer will be back in the 'add money' list.\n\n- When a reservation is made, a payment event will be created saying 'card deposit’.  The amount will appear in light orange to show you it's a reservation. The amount is taken from the account. The event will also tell you the day that the reservation was made.\n\n  - When the reservation is released (refunded), the event will say 'deposit refunded' and the amount will be crossed. The event will tell you the date that the reservation was made and the day of the refund.\n\n  - When the reservation will change into a partial refund, the event will say 'card payment' and will show the amount of the charged payment (this can be less than the reservation amount). The event will tell you the date of the reservation and the date that the payment was credited. \n\n- If you’re an Easy Money or Easy Green user, you can use Dual PIN for your Credit Card. You can learn more about how this works [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/1993).\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [How can I order a Credit Card?](https://together.bunq.com/d/22397)\n- [How does the bunq Credit Card work?](https://together.bunq.com/d/22393)\n- [What’s the difference between Credit, Debit and Metal Card?](https://together.bunq.com/d/3722)\n\nWant to learn more?

This means that the amount for the transaction is approved and reserved for the cardholder. In this scenario, the cardholder is the end client who is making a purchase from you.\n\nHowever, even though the payment has been authorized, it is still in a pending state. This is because the funds have not yet been transferred to your Bank Account. It takes 7 days for the funds to be received successfully and appear in your Bank Account. \n\n## Received payment\nAfter 7 days, the funds will be successfully received by you and visible in your Bank Account. \n## Refunded payment\n\nYou can always refund the desired amount to your client after the payment has been made and a refund was requested. The refund can be partial or full, depending on your agreement. Refunds are instant and when successful, a new refund event is created called “Refund successful”.\n\n## How can I refund a payment?\n\n1. Go to  Home\n2. Tap the Bank Account\n3.

    "source_text" : "Easy Investments - Invest in socially responsible companies \n\nHey bunqers \n\nIf you're a resident of The Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France or Luxembourg, we have some exciting news for you! You can now invest your savings in socially responsible assets with an Easy Investments account. Putting your money to work on sustainable goals has never been easier ✨\n\n### How does it work?\n\nTo make this possible and to make the most of your investing experience, we work together with [Birdee](https://birdee.co/en-eu/), a socially responsible company that offers meaningful investments to everyone. Through the bunq app, you can open an Easy Investments account with Birdee. Birdee will invest your money in a smart and sustainable way \n\nThere are 3 portfolio strategies to choose from:\n\n- Less Risk - lower risk, lower expected return\n- Some Risk - stability in risk and return\n- Vegas Baby! - more risk, higher expected return\n\nTo tailor the account to your risk profile, Birdee asks a few questions related to your risk appetite. Based on your answers, they advise you on which of these portfolios suit you best, however you can still make your own choice and choose the portfolio you want the most.\n\n## Who is Birdee?\nBirdee is our investment partner that has similar values to us. They have a strong focus on sustainability and want to make meaningful investments accessible to everyone. When you make use of Easy Investments, you’ll be opening an account with Birdee, who'll invest your money on your behalf. Have a look on [their website](https://birdee.co/en-eu/) to learn more about them.\n\n## What are socially responsible investments?\nSustainable and socially responsible investments fulfill social, ethical and environmental criteria. Birdee selects investments that allow creating a better world while providing attractive returns. They do so by taking 3 concrete steps.\n\n- They select the companies, organizations, and countries that have adopted environmentally friendly practices.\n- They exclude certain industries, such as arms trade, tobacco and coal industry, porn industry and others that can have a damaging impact on society.\n- They promote and encourage companies that take action to achieve sustainable development goals. \n\n## How do I sign up for an Easy Investments account?\n\n- Steps on how to create your Easy Investments account can be found [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/50205)\n\n## Are there any fees?\n\n- Further information can be found [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/50207)\n\n## What actually happens with my invested money?\n\n- Detailed information on the matter can be found [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/50211)\n\n## How can I update my Investor Information?\n\nDue to legal reasons, Birdee requires all users to update their investments portfolio information on a yearly basis. This way they can continue providing you an uninterrupted smooth investing experience. \n\nIf not updated in time, you won’t be able to withdraw your investments until you update the required info. How can you update your Investor Information? Check the easy steps below: \n\n1. Go to Home\n2. [Click here](https://www.bunq.com/tutorials/investor-information) or on your Easy Investments account \n3. Click on Settings (⚙️)\n4. Select \"Investor Information\"\n5. Update your info accordingly \n\n## Is an Easy Investments account safe?\n\nOf course! It's protected in multiple ways. When your money is transferred to Birdee, waiting to be invested, it’s protected by means of so-called ‘open escrow accounts’, which safeguard your funds against bankruptcy of Birdee or their bank. \n\nAs soon as your money is fully invested, it’s safe from the bankruptcy of either party. In addition to this, your investments (up to €20,000.00) are protected by the [Investor Compensation Scheme](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/consumer-finance-and-payments/retail-financial-services/investor-compensation-schemes_en), meaning that you’ll get investments up to this amount back if something happens to your investments because of operational errors or fraud.\n\nRemember, investing comes with risk and you can lose (part of) your money. There's no guarantee for returns and the value of your investments fluctuate with the market. \n\n## Does Easy Investment work with Auto Save?\nAbsolutely! It works the same as [Auto Save for Savings Goal](https://together.bunq.com/d/5148), but if you turn this on the funds will land in your Easy Investments account instead. \n\nWe’ll deposit the collected savings to your portfolio as soon as you hit the minimum required (€10.00) \n\n\n__________\n\n## Questions about investing?\nWe're ready to help you get up and running! However, bunq can't give any investment advice and isn't legally allowed to answer specific question relating to Easy Investments. Therefore in such cases we'll refer you to Birdee! Also, keep in mind that the questions in the app are asked by Birdee, not by bunq - if you have further questions, please check the [Birdee FAQ](http://help.birdee.co/en/articles/5179663-what-is-discretionary-management)\n\n## More questions regarding this feature?\nCheck the [Easy Investments FAQ](https://together.bunq.com/d/47562), your answer should be there \n\n## Related topics\n\n- [What are the Easy Investments account fees?](https://together.bunq.com/d/50207)\n- [Easy Investments FAQ](https://together.bunq.com/d/47562)\n- [How do I export an annual statement for my Easy Investments account?](https://together.bunq.com/d/50519)\n- [Issue with Easy Investments](https://together.bunq.com/d/51813)\n- [How do I sign up for an Easy Investments account?](https://together.bunq.com/d/50205)\n- [Why does Birdee regularly optimize my Easy Investments portfolio?](https://together.bunq.com/d/54694)\n\n\nExplore more bunq knowledge [here](https://go.bunq.com/link/knowledge) \n\n",

    "source_text" : "What's Dutch Tax Return and how do I report it?\n\nHey bunqers \n\nEvery year during April it’s Tax Return season. In this topic you can learn how to prepare for it with your bunq account. \n\n### What’s a Dutch Tax Return \n\nIf you’re an employee in the Netherlands, your employer takes a specific amount out of your paycheck and gives it to the tax authority (known as de Belastingdienst). \n\nWhen you file your tax return in the spring, you provide them with a more accurate insight into your income, assets and expenses of the past year. That way you’ll be able to calculate whether you paid too much or too little in income taxes.\n\nIf you’re an entrepreneur, you’ll have to notify the tax authority of your profits and any additional income. The tax return might be more extensive, so an option is to use a third party.\n\n## How do I report it? \n\nWhether you're an individual or entrepreneur, you can go to mijn.belastingdienst.nl or use the Belastingdienst app and find a pre-filled tax return. You should correct anything that’s incorrect in the pre-filled information, and add information if any is missing.\n\n**Note:** Dutch residents don’t need to report their Personal accounts to the Dutch Tax Authorities. Once you provide us with your BSN number and we enter it in our system, the Tax Authorities will be informed about your names, Tax Identification Number, and IBANs. \n\n## What documents are needed? \n\nWhat documents are needed depends heavily on what activities you’re involved in. However the documents mentioned below are a must-have \n\n**Important note:** Due to different circumstances or factors you may need to upload additional documents. You can see more about this [here](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/en/individuals/content/living-abroad-necessary-details-for-tax-return).\n\n**Personal information**\n\n- TIN / BSN \n- IBAN\n- DigiD\n\n**Income**\n\n- Annual statement or payslips\n- Received alimony (if applicable)\n\n**Bank account**\n\n- A yearly overview of past year for your bank account (you can export an Annual Overview by following the steps explained [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/2523))\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- [How do I export my annual account overview?](https://together.bunq.com/d/2523)\n- [Pro Tips for bunq Freelancers - Taxes made easy](https://together.bunq.com/d/39544)\n\nWant to learn more?

This type of account ensures that money below the legally stipulated minimum living funds can't be seized. For instance, if the minimum living funds in Germany are set at 1300 EUR/month and you have 1400 EUR in your account, only 100 EUR could be seized to fulfill the bailiff's request, even if the garnishment amount is higher.

Further information can be found [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/12503).\n\n## What’s the difference between the bunq Credit Cards and Debit Card (Mastercard)?\n\nThe bunq Credit Card is the best card option for worldwide traveling, as it gives you the best acceptance online and worldwide. With it, you get the overall usability of a credit card without the risk that comes along with credit.\n\nYou can use it when traveling for hotel reservations, car rentals and all other payments that require a deposit. This means larger merchant acceptance and more convenience on your holiday. The main difference is that it'll be accepted by merchants who only accept credit cards.\n\nHotels and car rentals sometimes had issues accepting our Debit Card (Mastercard) because they require a deposit and they'll only accept a credit card. This was then resolved with the Credit Card.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [How can I order a Credit Card?](https://together.bunq.com/d/22397)\n- [bunq Credit Card FAQs](https://together.bunq.com/d/12958)\n- [What’s the difference between Credit, Debit and Metal Card?](https://together.bunq.com/d/3722)",

    "source_text" : "How to use iDIN with bunq?\n\n\n\nHey bunqers  \n\niDIN is a secure method of verifying your age, identity and signing documents which is now provided by bunq. The beauty of iDIN is that now as a bunq user you will be able to identify yourself with third parties (government bodies, insurance agencies, web stores) using this centralized log-in. \n\n### What can I use iDIN for?\n\n- **Login**:  Log into accounts easily and securely (like your bunq account ).\n- **Age verification**: Tells a merchant (third party) if you are over 18 years old for things like ordering alcohol online or playing the lottery.\n- **Identification**: You can identify yourself to a third party organization. \n\n*See the **full list of available parties** [here](https://www.idin.nl/consumenten/waar-idin-gebruiken/).*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n## How do I log in with iDIN using my bunq account?\n\nUsing iDIN to login to bunq couldn’t be easier. You'll simply need to:\n\n- Scan the QR code\n- Confirm the information you are about to share. \n\n## How does it work?\n\n1. The merchant has integrated us in their list (like with iDEAL)\n2. When you tap bunq, you'll be redirected to one of our pages\n3. This page will contain a QR code and clearly state it's for iDIN\n4. If you're on mobile, you'll be redirected\n5. When the QR code is scanned, you'll be notified that you're using iDin and you'll receive a link leading to more information and a possibility to deny the login.\n6. Then we show you what information we're going to share with the merchant which you have to confirm\n7. An event will be kept in the timeline for future reference for up to 13 months.\n\nKeep in mind that you can always revoke identification from the in-app event's screen.\n\n-----\n \n## FAQ\n\n**Can everyone use iDIN?**\n\n* You must be 18 years or older to use iDIN \n\n**Is it available for all plans?**\n\n*  iDIN is available for all [Easy Bank](https://together.bunq.com/d/44002-easy-bank), [Easy Money](https://together.bunq.com/d/3762) and [Easy Green](https://together.bunq.com/d/26306) users in the Netherlands\n\n**What information can be shared through iDIN?**\n\n* Address, BSN, age, date of birth, gender, email address, phone number.\n\n**How does bunq guard my privacy?**\n\n* We will always ask for your permission before sharing any details.\n* We will never share payment details through iDIN (no balance, or IBAN).\n* bunq cannot see your personal details at the third party where you identify yourself.\n\n## Related topics \n\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "Easy Investments FAQ \n\nHey bunqers \n\nIn this FAQ you’ll be able to find all the information needed to navigate through the [Easy Investments feature](https://together.bunq.com/d/47183) and learn more about how it all works. Let’s dive into it!\n\n### Who can use Easy investments?\n\nCurrently the feature is available for residents in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France and Luxembourg. Also due to Birdee’s acceptance policy, you won't be able to open an Easy Investment account if you're a minor, US taxpayer or if your nationality is mentioned below:\n\nBahamas, Belarus, Botswana, Cambodia, Cuba, Ghana, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Panama, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Trinidad, Tobago, Ukraine, Venezuela and Yemen\n\n## How are the portfolios constructed\n\nBirdee’s experts have put those together with the help of specialists in this professional sphere. When you create your Easy Investment account, you’ll be asked several questions which will help you find which portfolio suits your investment objective and your risk profile the best.\n\n## What are the risks?\n\nLike any financial investment, Birdee portfolios carry risks. The absolute preservation of your starting capital can’t be guaranteed. \n\nBirdee monitors the performance of their portfolios on a daily basis and adjusts their composition to keep them in line with the objectives and risk profile you’ve chosen and to ensure the best return. \n\n\n## What are the fees?\n\n- You can check them [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/50207)\n\n## What’s an investment objective?\n\nDifferent objectives imply different risk tolerances and durations and the portfolio we recommend will take those into account. This way you’ll be able to invest with the most suitable portfolio for you. \n\n## Which companies does Birdee invest in?\n\nFurther information on which companies does Birdee invest in can be found in their website [here](https://birdee.co/en-eu/socially-responsible-investments/) and [here](https://birdee.co/en-eu/our-portfolios/).\n\n## How's the performance of my portfolios calculated?\n\nUnder your portfolios, you’ll see two key values : Earnings (€) and The yield (%)\n\nTo define the performance of its portfolios, Birdee uses the Time-Weighted Return method, which defines the relative performance of a portfolio. It means that the performance is net of the contributions and withdrawals that a user could make. Gains are the amounts of money earned compared to a starting bet.\n\n\n## How are Value and Performance calculated exactly?\n\n**The Value tab** on the Investments account shows the current value of the portfolio including deposits, withdrawals and movements in the market.\n\n**The Performance tab** shows a graph of the movements in the market.\n\n- **Example:** On Monday you invest 1000€ (Value). On Tuesday, the markets have risen by 10% (Performance), so you have gained 100€ (profit) and your portfolio is now worth 1100€ (Value). You then add 2000€ in the evening and your portfolio is now worth 3100€. On Wednesday, the markets are down by 5%. Your portfolio is now worth 2945€. This translates into a net loss of 55€ on the 3000€ invested in total. However, the performance in % will be 4.5%, i.e. positive: (1+10%)*(1-5%)-1 = 4,5%\n\n\n## How long does it take for my money to be invested and visible in my Easy Investment account?\n\nOnce Sutor Bank (Birdee's partner) receives the funds, it places them in the corresponding ETFs and sends Birdee the information and we apply it in the app right away. This means it may take **up to 5 business days** before the payment appears in your account \n\n## My Easy Investments account wasn’t approved. Why?\n\nThere are two main reasons why your investments account can be not approved by Birdee:\n\na) _Your ID has expired:_ \nWhen you create your bunq account, the ID must have been valid, but over time this document may have expired. In this case, you need to provide an updated ID so that you can get approved by Birdee. To do this, reach out to support. They can assist you further by activating an event for you to provide an updated ID in the app.\n\nb) _You’re a politically exposed person:_ \nIf you’re considered a politically exposed person, Birdee will request Income information so they can verify your account. You’ll be able to provide this information through the app by contacting the support team - from there, our team will forward your documents to Birdee and finish the verification. \n\nA politically exposed person is someone who was entrusted with an important public function during the last year and has significant decision-making power.\n\nThis could be a chairman of a political party, or the chairman of a state owned corporation. Close family members of such a person are also considered politically exposed. \n\n## Do I need to provide a TIN?\n\nIf you’re from Estonia, Spain, Italy, Iceland, Malta or Poland - you need to provide an additional TIN as per Birdee’s requirement. If it’s needed, you’ll receive an error message and you’ll be able to contact our support to provide this info. \n\n\n## What if my returns drop?\n\nNo need to worry or panic! Financial markets are always rising or falling. Just like interest rates and prices for everything! \n\nThe important thing to know is that Birdee as our partner makes every effort to rebalance the composition of your portfolio whenever the market requires it \n\n## How can I withdraw my funds?\n\nSimply follow these easy steps:\n\n1. Go to Home \n2. Select your Easy Investment account\n3. Click on  Withdraw \n\nIf you want to withdraw your funds invested in the market, please first make sure to not have any pending deposits\n\n## Why my withdrawal has been denied?\n\nIt is possible that your withdrawal was denied because you had pending deposits at the time of your request. Our partner Birdee is at the moment not able to process deposits and withdrawals simultaneously. To withdraw your funds please first make sure you don't have any pending deposits.\n\n## Can I close my account whenever I want?\n\nYes, you can, just follow these easy steps: \n\n1. Go to Easy Investments account\n2. Tap on ⚙️ \n3. Tap Close Easy Investments Account\n4. Tap Proceed\n\nIn order to close the account the balance must be €0.00, meaning that no funds should be left in the account. \n\n---\n\n## Can I cancel a deposit?\n\nIndeed, you can cancel a pending deposit to Birdee - these are Auto Save deposits which haven't reached the €10.00 minimum yet. All you need to do is to follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to Easy Investments account\n2. Tap the Pending Investments circle\n3. Tap the Deposit you want to cancel\n4. Tap Cancel Deposit\n\n---\n\n## How long does it take to withdraw my funds?\n\nWhen you make a withdrawal, you're selling part of your investments. To complete the sell order and get your money from the market, it may take up to 7 to 8 business days of processing time. Keep in mind that during the withdrawal, the value of your investment may change.\n\n---\n\n## What are the tax implications for my portfolios?\n\nOwning a securities account always has tax implications and the fiscal responsibility remains in your hands - it’s up to you to declare to the fiscal authorities all the elements related to the securities you hold.\n\nHowever, in order to make it easier for you, we’ll send you a yearly summary of your earnings so that you can share them with your tax department right away \n\n---\n\n## Can I use Easy Investments with a business account?\n\nNo. Easy Investments is currently only possible for personal accounts.\n\n## More questions on how to invest? \nCheck out [Birdee’s FAQ](https://birdee.co/en-eu/comment-ca-marche/) for more info.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [What are the Easy Investments account fees?](https://together.bunq.com/d/50207)\n- [Easy Investments - Invest in socially responsible companies ](https://together.bunq.com/d/47183)\n- [How do I export an annual statement for my Easy Investments account?](https://together.bunq.com/d/50519)\n- [Issue with Easy Investments](https://together.bunq.com/d/51813)\n- [How do I sign up for an Easy Investments account?](https://together.bunq.com/d/50205)\n- [Why does Birdee regularly optimize my Easy Investments portfolio?](https://together.bunq.com/d/54694)\n\n\nExplore more bunq knowledge [here](https://go.bunq.com/link/knowledge) \n",

Le premier chiffre est toujours 0, 1, 2 ou 3. L’administration fiscale française fournit un NIF à tous les particuliers ayant une obligation fiscale en France.\n\n-----\n\n## Où trouver mon numéro d’identification fiscale (NIF) ?\n \nLe NIF n’apparaît sur aucun document d’identité officiel (tel que la carte d'identité ou le Passeport).

    "source_text" : "Why do we request your SSN or CLN?\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nIn order to comply with the laws and regulations, we ask you for information on your tax residency within 90 days from signup. If you are a U.S. citizen, we will need some additional information.  \n\n### Wondering why?\n\nAccording to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), a financial institution is obliged to report financial information about U.S. persons (indirectly) to the American Tax Authorities. That includes:\n\n-  U.S. citizens, including those born in the United States, naturalized citizens, and individuals who have obtained U.S. citizenship through their parents\n-  US lawful permanent residents (green card holders)\n-  Individuals meeting the “substantial presence test” (physically present in the United States for at least 183 days during the current calendar year or a weighted average over three years.)\n-  Any U.S. corporation or partnership formed under U.S. state laws.\n-  Entities that qualify as U.S. persons based on substantial U.S. ownership or control criteria.\n-  Anyone *born in the U.S.* is automatically a *U.S. citizen* by law, and abolishment is only possible following the procedure for renouncement or relinquishment of nationality.  \n\nDue to these special regulations, we are required to ask all U.S. people to provide us with either their *Social Security Number (SSN)*, National ID, and State of residence or a *Certificate of Loss of Nationality (CLN)*. \n\n---\n\n## Social Security Number\n\nThe Social Security Number is a nine-digit number in the format AAA-GG-SSSS, and it helps the U.S. accurately record covered wages or self-employment earnings. The SSN is issued to U.S. citizens, permanent residents and temporary (working) residents, and it is necessary to get a job, to collect Social Security benefits and get some other government services. Once a citizen has been issued an SSN, it is difficult to opt out of the Social Security Program. One option is to revoke US citizenship. \n\nYou can find your SSN on your Social Security Card, tax returns, W2 forms or bank statements. \n\n---\n\n## Certificate of Loss of Nationality\nCitizens who receive a Certificate of Loss of Nationality surrender their United States passport and lose all rights of United States citizenship. You are allowed to prove that you aren't in fact an U.S. person/citizen by providing evidence of renouncement or relinquishment of citizenship and a proof that you have the nationality of another country.  \n\nDo you still have questions?

Yes, indeed - even if the terminal where you're paying is offline (for example on an airplane), you can still make a payment.\n\n### Things to keep in mind\n\n- You can spend up to €250 per day when offline. \n- This currently works with the Mastercard Credit & Debit Cards. It's not supported on Maestro Cards.\n- Since the payments will be offline, you won't receive an event in the app immediately, as only your card knows that the payment has been made. This information will come through later when the terminal goes online.\n- No need to order a new card in order to activate offline PIN - all applicable bunq cards support it automatically \n\n## How do I activate offline PIN on my cards?\nTo enable offline PIN, all you need to do is make a contact payment, i.e., insert your card into a terminal that's online \n\n## Does an offline terminal support my secondary PIN?\nNo, secondary PIN will not work with offline terminals, as the PIN validation will only take place on the card itself.\n\n## What happens if the daily limit is met when the offline payment is being processed?\nIf you've hit your daily limit, and make an offline payment, the offline payment will go through successfully. Only when we receive information about the payment will it contribute to the daily limit.\n\n## What happens if I make an offline payment for a larger amount than my balance?\nIf the offline payment exceeds the amount of your balance, your account will go into debt. For example, if you have 30€ in your account and make an offline payment for 50€, your account will be 20€ in debt. You can resolve that via the negative balance process [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/24781) ⭐️\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [How do I change my card's PIN code?](https://together.bunq.com/d/60)\n- [How do I solve a failed PIN payment?](https://together.bunq.com/d/50011)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "Why wasn't my Business account verified?\n\nHey bunqers \n\nYour safety and well-being are our priority. That’s why we have an Acceptance Policy in place to abide by legal regulations and follow some of our own risk standards as a bank. \n\nSome Business accounts may not get verified since they don’t fit our Acceptance Policy. Below, you can see the main reasons we might not verify certain Business accounts: \n\n## Complex Legal Structure\n\nTo ensure optimal user experience, we currently only provide our services to **small and mid-sized businesses with simple corporate structures**. This means that the following structures don’t fit our Acceptance Policy: \n\n- Foundations (Stichtingen) not managed by a natural person.\n- Any legal entity managed by a Stichting.\n- Companies with shares owned by companies without shares.\n- STAKs (Stichting Administratiekantoor) or companies with a STAK in their ownership structure.\n- Companies whose second layer includes one or more companies which are not a Besloten Vennootschap (or a foreign equivalent)\n- Stichting Derdengelden\n- **For Dutch companies**: Ownership structure which doesn't end with a natural person in Layer 3 (learn more about accepted layering [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/50212)) \n- **For companies outside The Netherlands**: Ownership structure which doesn't end with a natural person in Layer 2 (learn more about accepted layering [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/50212))\n- Companies whose layers contain businesses outside our [accepted forms](https://together.bunq.com/d/221)\n\nYou can learn more about the structures we accept [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/50212)\n\n## Activities aren’t in line with our risk profile\n\nIn order to provide you our services, we should make sure that your business activities are in line with our risk appetite. This means that if your business activities are too risky activities, we’ll have to postpone your verification until further changes in our Acceptance Policy.\n\n* You can learn more about business activities [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/54514)\n\n## You’re not the director of the company \n\nTo keep your money safe, we currently only allow authorized representatives of a business to open an account. When we verify your business, we make sure to double-check all the provided info with the Chamber Of Commerce’s database. \n\nIf a director mismatch is found, we’ll let you know right away! \n\nIf this is a misunderstanding, you can contact us via Support from [here](https://go.bunq.com/link/support) and provide a document stating you’re authorized to represent the company.\n\n## Director's Personal account isn't verified \n\nAs a bank, we're legally required to store all of our users’ personal information in a secure way. Creating Personal accounts for the directors of the Business accounts allows us to keep your and your company’s information safe while complying with this regulation. More info can be found [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/38241).\n\nIn order to finish your Business' verification, all directors should have verified and active Personal accounts. See how to verify your Personal account [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/24112). \n\n## Unsupported Legal Form\n\nWe only accept a limited range of legal forms within the countries eligible for Business accounts. That’s why, if your company doesn’t match our supported types of business for the country you reside in, we won’t be able to verify your account. \n\n* You can check the supported legal forms per countries [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/221)\n\n## Minor Director \n\nAt this moment, we don’t allow minors to open Business accounts or be a part of the corporate structure, as per our Acceptance policy.\n\n* You can check more info on our Acceptance Policy [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/1014) \n \n## Business isn’t active in the Chamber Of Commerce\n\nIf your company isn’t registered with an active status in the Chamber Of Commerce’s database, we won’t be able to continue with your company’s account verification. \n\nOnce your business’ status changes back to active, we’ll be more than happy to review your application again. Just make sure to contact us via Support from [here](https://go.bunq.com/link/support).\n\n## High monthly transaction volume \n\nIf the expected monthly transaction volume doesn’t fit our current focus towards small and mid-sized businesses, that could also lead to a more extended review process to determine if we can currently support your stated volumes. \n\nAs of now, we don’t support businesses with monthly transaction volume above €5,000,000.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [Who can open a bunq Business account?](https://together.bunq.com/d/54514)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "How does the Pre-Authorization work?\n\nHey bunqers \n\nSometimes when you do a card payment, the payment gets pre-authorized. What does that mean? Read all about it below \n\n### What is a pre-authorized payment?\n\nThe pre-authorization is an acknowledgement to the merchant that the account has sufficient funds and a reservation for a certain amount of money was successful. Therefore, the pre-authorization isn’t a finalized payment - your funds didn’t leave your account yet, but they were reserved for the merchant. Keep in mind that when you do a pre-authorization the amount is still deducted from your Bank Account, so that you can get a real overview of your balance. \n\n## How does pre-authorization work? \n\nWhen you're done with the payment, the merchant should notify bunq within 20 minutes (for Europe) or within 1 hour (US/Canada) in regards to the payment event. \n\nThe authorization is rarely delayed to a couple of hours, where the finalization message isn’t sent to us (especially in credit card based countries). In this case, we adjust the transaction amount only after receiving the request, which can take up to a few days. \n\nOnce the pre-authorization is done, the merchant has to settle the exact amount (a.k.a proceed with the payment and claim the reserved funds from your account). Once they claim the funds - the payment has been successfully done. If the transaction wasn’t complete for a different reason, and the period of 7 or 30 days (depending on the merchant) has passed, you can request a chargeback by following the steps mentioned [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/47826) and we'll reverse the amount.\n\n## What should I do if the payment doesn’t proceed within an hour?\n\nThe best advice is to always wait for the payment to get authorized as per the steps explained above. If you have any issues with the payment, make sure to contact the merchant first as explained [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/27036) and request an in-app refund as explained [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/47826) \n\n__________\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [What does the status of my card payment mean?](https://together.bunq.com/d/16793)\n- [Easily rent a car with your bunq credit card ](https://together.bunq.com/d/45349)\n- [How to request an in-app refund?](https://together.bunq.com/d/47826)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "What documents do I need to provide to open a Business account? \n\nHey bunqers  \n\nTo make sure you can open an account with us in 5 minutes, one of the things we need to know is the UBO (ultimate beneficial owner) of your business. We'll need one or more of the following documents as proof:\n\n### What do you need to provide in general?\n\n- [Registration Number](https://together.bunq.com/d/48890)\n\n- [Deed of Incorporation](https://together.bunq.com/d/48891)\n\n- [Written consent for jointly authorized directors](https://together.bunq.com/d/48897)\n\n- [Shareholders registry](https://together.bunq.com/d/48898)\n\n- [Director’s proof of residence](https://together.bunq.com/d/20843)\n\n## Why do we need to know this? \nLong story short... it’s required by law:\n\nWe're obliged under the 4th EU Money Laundering Directive (4MLD) to register the name(s), date of birth and ID of the businesses’ Ultimate Beneficial Owner. \n\nFor capital companies an UBO is a natural person who has an interest of more than 25% through direct or indirect ownership, or who controls the entity. For foundations and associations an UBO is a natural person who directly or indirectly holds more than 25% of ownership or is entitled to vote for more than 25% with respect to an amendment of the articles of association, or has control of the entity. For partnerships the UBO is a natural person who directly or indirectly holds more than 25% of the ownership, or is entitled to vote for more than 25% or has control of the partnership. \n\nAt bunq, we identify UBOs as individuals who hold precisely 25% or more ownership in a company. Consequently, we request each person with this level of ownership to share the necessary information about themselves.\n\nFor this reason, you’ll need to provide us with some documentation.

    "source_text" : "Everything about refunds \n\nHey bunqers \n\nWas the item that you purchased not delivered, or was the service that you paid for not as described? Is the merchant unreachable or unwilling to help?\n\n### What is a refund?\n\nA refund (a.k.a chargeback) is a form of purchase protection by Mastercard. In the case of disagreement between you and the merchant, we can formally dispute the payment via the Mastercard collaboration network. Don't know how to get one? No worries, we’re here to help you \n\nDon’t forget to check our tips on [how to recognize fraud and stay safe](https://together.bunq.com/d/40318)\n\nDo you not recognize the payment and suspect that your account has been fraudulently charged? You can learn more what to do [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/23367)\n\n## How can I get a refund?\n\n**To request a refund via the app, follow the steps explained [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/47826)** \n\nUnless the transaction is unrecognized, always make sure to contact the merchant regarding the transaction that needs a refund. In most cases the refund is done by the merchant and the whole process takes a couple of business days. \n\nMost merchants would happily assist you in correcting the charge and returning your money. That's why before using Mastercard purchase protection, we ask you to settle your dispute with the merchant.\n\n **Tip ** We always advise you to contact them by chat or e-mail so you have the transcript of your communication with them. Make sure you share your order reference details with the merchant. This ensures their support team understands your situation correctly, and can provide you with the right solutions.\n\n## What happens next?\n\nOnce the relevant waiting period has passed you have provided us with necessary documentation, and the request meets Mastercard’s refund conditions, we can proceed with performing the refund ourselves.\n\nIt's important to note that the merchant's still able to dispute the refund within 45 days, please check our [pricing sheet](https://www.bunq.com/en/pricing-sheet), for more information about incidental costs. Our team will remain at your disposal to help you throughout the whole process.\n\n **Tip ** Speed up the process by uploading your order confirmation, communication with the merchant, and any other relevant documents when you request a chargeback in the app. \n\n**Important:** The process of reviewing your claim and processing with the refund may take from 1 to 12 business weeks. Depending on the individual case, different steps may be taken within the process. We kindly ask for your patience, and we'll update you along the way!\n\n## Types of refunds\n\nbunq deals with 2 types of card refunds: pre-authorization releases, and chargebacks. Still not sure what can be refunded? Learn more [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/49940).\n\n### Pre-authorizations \n\nPre-authorized payments aren’t finalized ones but a reservation of your funds for the merchant as a way to ensure you have sufficient amounts in your account. \n\nYou can request a refund on these types of payments. The estimated time for the refund’s processing is from 8 to 31 days depending on the merchant’s industry. A proof of release sent to your Support Center will ensure faster processing \n\nFurther information about them can be found [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/48140).\n\nIf the payment was already settled with the merchant and the refund request gets denied, proceed by requesting another refund, which will be considered as a chargeback.\n\n### Chargebacks \n\nChargeback is a form of purchase protection from Mastercard. In case of disagreement between you and a merchant, we can formally dispute the payment via the Mastercard collaboration network. \n\nFurther information on this matter can be found [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/48165)\n\n## Can I get a refund on a Direct Debit?\n\nYou can easily request a refund for a Direct debit by following the steps explained [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/47826) \n\nThe refund is only available within 56 days of the direct debit is accepted. However, it's not available to Business to Business direct debits. When you request the refund, we'll inform the merchant you want your funds back so they can help you further. \n\n## Can I get a refund on my subscription plan?\n\nThe answer is yes, if you contact us within 24 hours from the billing moment. To request this refund, you can contact our [Support Team via the in-app chat](https://together.bunq.com/d/32181) and inform us which plan you want to use. \n\nBefore requesting your new plan, make sure your account fits into the plan’s applicable benefits (number of Bank Accounts and cards active).\n\n ## I made a transfer to the wrong IBAN. How can I get my money back?\n\n- **If you're not a bunq user** - you need to report this to your own bank, so that they can pick up the case accordingly ; \n- **If you're a bunq user and you know the beneficiary** - make sure to contact the beneficiary yourself and request the returning of the undue payment ;\n- **If you're a bunq user and you don't know the beneficiary** - contact [bunq support](https://www.bunq.com/link/support), we'll contact the counter-bank or the beneficiary (in case they're a bunq user) with the request to return the undue payment.\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [How to request an in-app refund?](https://together.bunq.com/d/47826)\n- [How are my refunds processed?](https://together.bunq.com/d/48165)\n- [I need a refund for a card payment - what should I do?](https://together.bunq.com/d/49932)\n- [When can I request a refund and what do I need to do?](https://together.bunq.com/d/49933)\n- [How do I know if I received the refund?](https://together.bunq.com/d/49938)\n- [What can’t be refunded?](https://together.bunq.com/d/49940)\n- [Can I receive my refund to a closed Bank Account or blocked card?](https://together.bunq.com/d/49943)\n\nExplore more bunq Knowledge [here](https://together.bunq.com/t/knowledge) ",

    "source_text" : "Why am I not receiving MassInterest?\n\n\nHey bunqers \n\nThere are a couple of possible reasons why you might not see or not receive your MassIntrest on your payout date. You can find more information and possible troubleshooting steps below: \n\n### Check your Payday settings\n\nMake sure you have your bunq Payday toggle enabled. If this toggle has been disabled you won’t receive MassInterest. Furthermore, the sub-account you’ll receive your pay out is your billing one. Further information can be found [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/57060). \n\nThe MassIntrest from your Multi Currency Savings Account will be paid out in the oldest active sub-account you have in this currency. \n\n### Check your bunq Plan\n\nbunq MassInterest is applicable for Easy Savings, Easy Bank, Easy Money and Easy Green.\n\nIf you’re still on Easy Travel, it’s possible that you’re not receiving interest, since it’s not part of the plan’s benefits. In order to start receiving interest again, you can change your plan to one of the above-mentioned, by following the easy and fast steps explained [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/3317)\n\n### See if you have to provide more verification documents \n\nIt’s possible that your account still needs to be verified and we’ve requested some documents from you in the app. \n\nBe sure to check your Home Tab or Profile Tab for any awaiting events which may require you to provide extra information in order to fully verify your account. \n\n### See if your balance is able to generate €0.01\n\nIf the balance in your Savings Account isn’t able to generate at least €0.01 on a daily basis, we won’t be able to make a payout.

No extra hardware needed!\n\n### How does it work?\n\nPlease follow the steps below to send a Payment File: \n1. Open the file with the **bunq app**\n2. Tap **send payment**\n3. Click on **continue**\n4.

But only now I realize there was a mistake! Can you book the payment back? Will you cover the damages due to this?**\nA: It is never possible to book back an SCT payment, as the inter-bank system does not allow the refund option. The best way to get your money back is getting in touch with the recipient to ask if they can send the money back. bunq is not liable for mistakes in the XML file processing: we always show you a preview of the payment(s), so that you can double-check that all details are correct. \n\n**Q: I've some XML files on my computer that I'd need to process. Is there a way to send them to my bunq app directly?**\nA: At the moment, you'll need to open the XML file on your phone. Only when you open the XML file from your phone, you'll have the option to open it with the bunq app for the processing of the payments. To do this, you can, for example, send the file to your email address and open the email from your phone. Of course, we welcome your feedback on Together for future improvements!\n\n**Q: How do I import an XML file on iOS?**\nA: You can airdrop the XML file to your iPhone, download it from your accounting app or have in your email app. Then simply tap on it and select the option to open it with bunq. The bunq app will open the file and process the batch.\n\n**Q: How do I import an XML file on Android?**\nA: You can save the file on the storage of your phone, or download it. Then choose to open it with the bunq app. However, it's good to know there's an exception with Gmail that doesn't allow opening of XML files.\n\n**Q: Is it possible to schedule the XML batch to be paid in the future, instead of immediately when uploading?**\nA: Unfortunately, the processing date is not considered and the payments are directly processed.\n\n\n---\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- [How can I make a payment?](https://together.bunq.com/d/115)\n\nWant to learn more?

Wenn du ein bereits registrierter bunqer mit Wohnsitz in Deutschland bist, werden wir in Kürze weitere spannende Neuigkeiten für dich haben. Es besteht keine Notwendigkeit, ein neues Privatkonto zu eröffnen, um deine deutsche IBAN zu erhalten.

Wir werden dich benachrichtigen, sobald du deine neue Deutsche IBAN bekommen kannst! \n\n## Und was, wenn ich bereits verifiziert bin und meine niederländischen IBANs behalten möchte?\nFür uns steht es an erster Stelle, dir vollkommene Freiheit zu geben. Das bedeutet, dass wenn du ein deutscher bunqer mit verifiziertem bunq-Konto und niederländischen IBANs bist, du deine niederländischen IBANs behalten kannst. Wenn du dich dafür entscheidest, werden alle deine neuen Unterkonten automatisch niederländische IBANs erhalten genau wie es auch bisher der Fall war. Und solltest du es dir in der Zukunft anders überlegen, keine Sorge - du kannst dich jederzeit dafür entscheiden, deutsche IBANs zu erhalten. Öffne dafür deine Adress-Einstellungen (sobald diese Funktion für bereits verifizierte Nutzerinnen verfügbar ist). Denk bitte darauf, dass nur diese Option verfügbar ist. Nachdem du gewählt hast, deutsche IBANs zu bekommen, ist es nicht mehr möglich, das Land für die IBANs zu verändern, weil du in Deutschland wohnst.

    "source_text" : "Anti-Fraud Guide: I've been scammed. What can I do?\n\n\n\nHey bunqers \n\nDiscovering you’re a victim of fraud is an unpleasant experience. It’s perfectly natural to be angry, but it’s really important to remember that you have the power to help yourself and also help others to avoid becoming a victim. We prepared this topic to help you understand what you should do if you discover that you’re a victim of fraud.\n\n**Need to report a fraud incident to bunq? Fill out [this form](https://www.bunq.com/report) to report your incident and help us to fight fraud!**\n\n### I was scammed, what do I do now?\n\n- **Report it to your bank’s customer support**\n  - Give all available details of the scam and the fraudulent transaction. The details that you should share are all key information of the fraudulent payment (sender's name, sender's IBAN, recipient's name, recipient's IBAN, amount, date, etc). If the payment was made via a credit/debit card, please include the first 6 and last 4 digits of the card used. Also include any relevant screenshots or export of the payment confirmation as shown on your bank statements.\n\n- **Report it to the police**\n  - Also, report the scam to the police to make them aware too. In the Netherlands for example you can report these types of incidents online [here](https://www.politie.nl/aangifte-of-melding-doen). Once a police report has been made forward it both to your bank and the scammer's bank in order to further assist in the case.\n\n## Will I be able to get a refund?\n\nRefunds for fraud through your bank or a court decision is possible, but it’s very important that you [follow the correct procedures](https://www.politie.nl/onderwerpen/internetoplichting.html). As stated above, the most important thing to do is report the incident to your bank and the police. Both of these groups can help you through different processes:\n\n- **The police**\n  - The police can start a criminal investigation thanks to the report. The criminal investigation can lead to a trial for the scammer, and a judge can then order the scammer to pay back the victims.\n\n- **Your bank**\n  - Your own bank will be able to contact the bank of the scammer via a special channel, to check if it's possible to get the money back.\n\nReporting the scam is important not only for your own case but allowing banks and the police to better identify scams in the future to help others.\n\n## What to do if you don’t trust a bunq.me link?\nIf you receive a bunq.me payment link and you suspect it's fraud, please use the report button to report the page to our compliance team. The team will immediately take action against the account.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [How to recognize fraud and stay safe?](https://together.bunq.com/d/40318) \n- [What’s phishing and how to recognize it?](https://together.bunq.com/d/54498) \n- [Spoofing - The dynamic ways of scamming nowadays, explained](https://together.bunq.com/d/45398) \n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "Who can open a bunq business account in France \n\nHey bunqers  \n\nYour safety and well-being are our priority. We have an acceptance policy in place to abide by legal regulations and follow some of our own risk standards as a company.\n\nAfter you complete the sign-up process in 5 minutes, we'll quickly review your application. We assess each application individually to make sure every company is held to the same standard and fulfils all requirements.\n\nbunq [Easy Savings](https://together.bunq.com/d/48095), [Easy Bank](https://together.bunq.com/d/44002-easy-bank), [Easy Money](https://www.bunq.com/business) and [Easy Green](https://together.bunq.com/d/26307) let you save time, so you can focus on what's truly important: your business. Wondering if you can sign up for a business account? Check out the requirements for opening an account below:\n\n### Who can open an account?\n\nHere are the basic conditions you need to meet in order to open a bunq business account:\n\n- You need to have a verified personal account with bunq.\n- You as a director cannot be a minor.\n- You need to run a legitimate business in France .\n- You need to be permanently residing in France \n- Your business should operate under one of the legal forms currently accepted by bunq. Find the full list [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/9256).\n- Your company’s corporate structure and activities should comply with bunq’s requirements. More details on this below.\n- Your business entity cannot have more than one account with bunq.\n- If your company has multiple trade names (under the same registration on the Chamber of Commerce) - you can effortlessly open a sub-account with the different names like we explain [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/24341-trade-names-for-your-business-bank-accounts).\n- If the various layers of your company are registered as separate legal entities with the Chamber of Commerce (Chambre du Commerce), each one would need its own Business accounts.\n\nOnce we confirm the above-mentioned conditions are met, we need to determine whether your business entity is registered with the local Chamber of Commerce or, in specific situations, you are operating on a freelance basis. Depending on that, we require different documents in order to approve your account.\n\nPlease also keep in mind that as a bank, we are legally required to store all of our user’s personal information in a secure and protected way. If there is more than one director,  we create personal accounts for each director of the business accounts. It allows us to keep your information and your company’s information safe while complying with regulations. Check out [this topic](https://together.bunq.com/d/38241) for more information.\n\n---\n\n## Legal forms and documents\n\nIn order to open a business account with bunq, you need to provide a legal form together with a few documents.

A beneficial owner is a natural person directly or indirectly holding more than 25% of the company's capital or voting rights;\n - Joint authorization consent form (if more than one director is present)\n - [If needed] A proof of address of the SAS/SASU less than three months old (hosting certificate attached to a proof of domicile that’s less than 3 months old, in case the domicile of the company is with its president);\n\n\n\nPlease find more information on legal documents [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/24017).\n\n---\n\n## Company activities\n\nIn accordance with our acceptance policy, we do not support all types of businesses and activities.

Es ist vollkommen normal, dass du sauer wirst. Allerdings ist es sehr wichtig, dich daran zu erinnern, dass du die Macht hast, dir selbst zu helfen und auch dazu beizutragen, zukünftige Fälle zu vermeiden. Diesen Artikel haben wir veröffentlicht, damit du verstehen kannst, was gemacht werden sollte, wenn du ein Betrugsopfer bist.\n \n## Ich wurde betrogen, was sollte ich jetzt tun?\n\n**- Melde es dem Kundendienst deiner Bank**\n\nGib alle vorhandenen Details des Betrugs und der arglistigen Transaktion an. Die Daten, die du mitteilen solltest, sind die Daten der betrügerischen Transaktion (Name des Senders, IBAN des Senders, Name des Empfängers, IBAN des Empfängers, Betrag, Datum, etc). Füge bitte alle relevanten Screenshots oder einen Export der Zahlungsbestätigung hinzu, wie es auf dem Auszug zu sehen ist.\n**- Melde es der Polizei**\n\nMelde den Betrug bei der Polizei, damit auch sie darüber Bescheid weiß. Z.B. in den Niederlanden könntest du diese Art von Vorfällen hier online melden.\n\n## Werde ich eine Rückerstattung bekommen können?\n\nRückerstattungen durch deine Bank oder eine gerichtliche Entscheidung aufgrund von Betrug sind möglich, allerdings ist es wichtig dem richtigem Vorgehen zu folgen. So wie oben beschrieben, ist das Wichtigste wäre den Vorfall bei deiner Bank und bei der Polizei zu melden. Beide Gruppen können dir durch unterschiedliche Prozesse helfen. \n\n**- Die Polizei**\n\nDie Polizei kann eine strafrechtliche Ermittlung dank des Reports einleiten. Die strafrechtliche Ermittlung könnte zu einem Prozess für den Betrüger führen und ein Richter kann dann anordnen, dass der Betrüger den Opfern alles erstatten muss.\n\n**- Deine Bank**\n\nDeine eigene Bank hat die Möglichkeit, Kontakt mit der Bank des Betrügers über einen Sonderkanal aufzunehmen und zu überprüfen, ob die Option besteht, das Geld zurückzubekommen.\nDen Betrug zu melden ist nicht nur für deinen eigenen Fall wichtig, sondern würde es auch den Banken und der Polizei ermöglichen, in der Zukunft Betrugsfälle besser zu identifizieren, um anderen zu helfen.\n\n## Musst du einen Betrugsfall bei bunq melden?\n\nFülle diese Formular aus, um den Fall zu melden und hilf uns den Betrug zu bekämpfen.\n\nWas ist zu tun, wenn du einen bunq.me Link nicht vertraust?\nFalls du einen bunq.me Link bekommen hast und Betrug vermutest tippe bitte auf den Report Button, um den Fall bei unserem Compliance Team zu melden.

    "source_text" : "Why do I need to fill in a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)?\n\nIn agreement with other countries to prevent fraud and tax evasion, the Dutch government shares citizens' tax information based on the Common Reporting Standard (CRS).\n\n### Why should I provide my TIN?\n\nAs a bank, we are legally required to ask new users where they are a tax resident and to provide us with their corresponding tax numbers (check [here](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/privacy-en-persoonsgegevens/vraag-en-antwoord/welke-organisaties-mogen-mijn-burgerservicenummer-bsn-gebruiken) for more info). This applies to bunqers from all countries and you have **90 days** after signup to provide this. If you fail to meet the deadline, your account will be temporarily limited until we receive the required document showing your Tax Identification Number from you. Are you experiencing difficulties submitting your TIN via the app? You can also submit it by reaching out to our [Support Team via the in-app chat](https://together.bunq.com/d/32181).\n\nYour tax residency doesn't always depend on the country where you live. You can be tax liable in more than one country. For instance, if you are a US person, you will have to report income tax to the IRS even when living abroad. \n\n* **Important note**: If you were born in the US, keep in mind that our relevant team will ask you to also provide your SSN number.

To make sure everyone in the bunq Community has an enjoyable experience, we have a few guidelines we like to follow. \n\n- **Stay safe and secure** \n\nPlease keep in mind that this is a public forum, readable by everyone on the internet, so never discuss or share private information. Instead, ask us privately and [contact support](https://www.bunq.com/link/support). No one working at bunq will ever ask you publicly to provide login credentials, security codes, card info, etc.\n\n- **Enjoy yourself and spread the joy** \n\nPlease contribute to the community’s positive atmosphere by being respectful and bringing those good vibes. Our moderators will step in whenever they see anything negative, disrespectful, spammy or hateful.  \n\nSome violations of these guidelines may also lead to a suspension (either temporary or permanent). Of course, feedback in a constructive and positive manner is always welcome—let's create a community you want to be a part of! \n\n- **No-no’s** ❗️\n\nNeedless to say that cursing, swearing, spamming, flooding, trolling, insulting, asking for money, posting inappropriate photography and the like is strongly prohibited and may lead to further restrictions.\n\n- **Stay unique and be curious** \n\nTo keep all knowledge on Together as accessible as possible, it's best to stay on-topic and avoid creating duplicate topics within the same thread. Therefore, it’s best to always double check if your question has already been asked by using the Search option or simply by putting your question into Google. \n\nBy keeping everything in one place, it's much easier for everyone to join the convo, pitch in and understand what's going on. Keep in mind that our moderators have the right to remove threads or comments if they’re off-topic or already answered. \n\n- **Need help? Ask Support!** \n\nOur community is full of knowledge, however in cases where you need help with the app, make sure to reach out to our [Support team](https://www.bunq.com/link/support). They can help you out with any case and assist you in any matter. Keep in mind that once you’ve opened a chat in the Support inbox, your case will be picked up as soon as possible by one of our guides. Please, make sure to keep your conversation active and not close it right after, so that a guide can assist you further. \n\n---\n\n### Meet our Moderators:\n\n\n\nThese special bunq users are our Moderators. We hold them in high regard and are immensely grateful for all of their (volunteer!) work. They have an eye (and heart) for all bunq users. They also have the right to apply the guidelines above in full force across the Community—it’s their job here \n\nThey also make sure Together is a diverse and exciting place where *all* different kinds of bunqers enjoy being. They are impartial: to us, to individual users, even to their own personal interests.\n\nIf you see a moderator please be respectful and mindful of all their hard work, without them Together just wouldn't be the same. \n\n\n### Enjoy Together! \n",

They’ll be able to view it, use it to make payments, top it up… even link their own cards to it! \n\n### How does Shared Access work?\nTo see how to set up Shared Access in the bunq app, check out the steps below:\n\n1. Home\n2. Select your Bank Account\n3. Tap on ⚙️ Settings\n4. Tap on “Granted Access To”\n5. Choose your buddy 欄 \n6. You're done!\n\n---\n\n**Important note**: To make your shared finances easier & clearer, we’ve simplified the way sharing access to Bank Accounts works. Anyone you invited or will invite to share a Bank Account with, will see the **complete transaction history of that account** since the day it was created. Learn more about this [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/55169) \n\n---\n\n## What is the difference between a Joint account and Shared Access?\n\nA [Joint account](https://together.bunq.com/d/196-how-do-i-create-a-joint-en-of-bank-account) is an account where there's more than one owner. All owners will be legal owners, and therefore the account is in all their names. A Shared Access account is a Bank Account where you give access to your friend/family member. You'll stay the legal owner of the account.\n\n## How can I cancel Shared Access?\n\n1. Go to Home tab\n2. Select your Bank Account\n3. Tap on ⚙️ Settings\n4. Tap on “Granted Access To”\n5. Select and cancel the Shared Access\n\n## Good to know\n\n- Available for Easy Bank, Easy Money and Easy Green.\n- Easy Savings users can receive and accept Shared Access requests from other users. However, they can't grant Shared Access to their own Bank Accounts.\n- Invitees are able to link their personal card to the Shared Access\n- All funds on the Shared Access Bank Account count for the owner for Tax Authorities.\n- If a card is linked to the Shared Access Bank Account the transaction fees + card withdrawal fees will be for the owner of the Shared Access Bank Account, not the card owner.\n- You can't share access for two Business Accounts. You can only share from a Personal to a Personal Account or from a Business Account to a Personal one.\n- If the invitee is unverified, this can cause an issue in the app, so it's best to advise the invitee to [verify](https://together.bunq.com/d/24112) first.\n- It's not possible for the user with Shared Access to make iDeal payments as it wouldn't be possible to wait for the director to approve first.\n- Invitees aren't able to schedule payments.\n- Keep in mind that all Shared Access accounts count towards your Bank Account limit according to [your plan](https://together.bunq.com/d/3892).\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [How does Shared Access work for my Business account?](https://together.bunq.com/d/8488)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "How can I send money to my phone contacts with bunq.to link?\n\nHey bunqers \n\nVia bunq.to link, you can now send money without the hassle of asking for an IBAN number. Funds can be sent directly to the receiver’s phone number or email address and give them the freedom to decide which bank account they want to receive them on.\n\n### What is bunq.to?\n\nIt’s a feature you can use to send money to phone numbers or email addresses that aren't linked to a bunq account. So you can easily send money to any of your contacts  \n\n## How can I send funds via bunq.to?\n\n You can send money via bunq.to by following these simple steps:\n\n1. Go to  Home Page\n2. Tap on Pay\n3. Enter an email address or phone number \n4. Tap on “Send payment”\n5. Done \n\n## What happens after I send the link to the receiver?\n\nAfter sending the bunq.to payment, the receiver will either receive an email or a SMS which contains a link that leads to the bunq.to webpage. On this webpage the receiver can enter their IBAN, to which the money will be sent as a regular [SEPA transfer](https://together.bunq.com/d/4295). \n\nA bunq.to payment expires after 5 days, if the recipient doesn't claim the payment. The money will then return to your bunq bank account and we’ll let you know with a notification.\n\n## Are there any limits?\n\nIt’s also good to know that there's a limit of **€50,000 total per day**. You can check out this [topic](https://together.bunq.com/d/6635-what-are-my-daily-limits) for more information.\n\n\n### Good to know\n\n- You can send money through bunq.to in EUR only. For outgoing payments in other currencies, you’ll need the receiver’s bank account details.\n\n- A bunq.to payment expires after 5 days of no response. The money will then return to the sender's bank account.\n\n- The difference between shared requests and all other types of requests is that a shared request isn't directed to a specific person. A shared request only contains the amount of money that's requested. After confirming the request you'll get an URL that can be shared via multiple platforms (WhatsApp, Messenger, email) to an unlimited number of people. \n\n- A shared request closes after 30 days and can be paid by an unlimited amount of people through iDEAL or SOFORT \n\n## Related topics\n\n- [How do I send transfers with Wise?](https://together.bunq.com/d/5149)\n- [When will I receive my payment?](https://together.bunq.com/d/4295)\n- [In-app Payment Investigations ️‍♂️](https://together.bunq.com/d/46954) \n",

    "source_text" : "How do I solve a failed PIN payment?\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nIn this topic we'll list some of the reasons behind a failed PIN payment and how to resolve it.\n\n### Wrong PIN \n\nIf the payment is declined because a wrong PIN has been entered, the screen of the terminal and your bunq app will tell you so. In this situation, you should [change your card’s PIN](https://go.bunq.com/link/set-pin) which will instantly be updated in our system. However, if you try to pay again right after, a few terminals might not be able to read the updated PIN code on the chip of your card and give you the same error message. In this situation, you should make an ATM transaction to ensure that the PIN code of your card gets updated on the chip of your card as well. \n\n*Note: If you entered the wrong PIN code 3 times, you'll need to [reset it](https://together.bunq.com/d/60-change-a-cards-pin) in the bunq app to complete the payment.*\n\n### Country isn't allowed \n\nWhen you're travelling, it might happen that your card payments get declined because the country you're visiting isn't enabled yet. You can easily change that by adding it to your list of enabled countries or by enabling card payments worldwide. You can see how to do this [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/2815).\n\n### Card isn't active \n\nIn order to be approved, card payments must be done with an active card. This means that if you've just ordered your card and haven't activated it yet or if your card is temporarily frozen, the payment won't go through. In such cases, you should first [activate your card](https://together.bunq.com/d/3985) before you try to pay again. \n\n### Exceeded daily limit \n\nTo protect your money, we've set a default daily limit of [€1,000 per day that can be adjusted up to €50,000 per day](https://together.bunq.com/d/6635). You can always change it by following the steps presented on this [link](https://together.bunq.com/d/4757).\n\n### Cash withdrawals \nIf you can’t withdraw money at an ATM, you should first check that you haven’t reached your [daily limit of €500](https://together.bunq.com/d/4757-changing-my-daily-card-limit) set for all bunq cards and keep in mind that the ATM might've its own limit too. Please try withdrawing a lower sum can help you withdraw correctly.\n\n### Insufficient balance \nWhen you're trying to pay an amount bigger than the balance on your account, the payment won't go through to make sure you don’t fall into debt. \n\nIn this situation, you should [top up your account](https://together.bunq.com/d/2933) or [link your card to another bunq Bank Account](https://together.bunq.com/d/233) to complete the payment.\n\n### Will there be an error shown on the POS terminal? ❌\n\nWhen you pay on a POS terminal, errors with different messages can appear on it if the payment fails. Some of them will state the exact reason why this card payment has failed and others will show a different type of error. This might be caused by the card not being accepted by the terminal so we suggest trying another card of yours or try paying with your Google or Apple Pay.\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [How do I change my card's PIN code?](https://together.bunq.com/d/60)\n- [How does bunq keep my card secure?](https://together.bunq.com/d/2815)\n- [How do I activate and deactivate my card?](https://together.bunq.com/d/3985)\n- [How can I change my daily card limit?](https://together.bunq.com/d/4757)\n- [How do I link my card to a different Bank Account (IBAN)?](https://together.bunq.com/d/233)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "Wise Payments FAQ\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nWondering how to convert payments in other currency to Euros, to you receive it in your bunq account? Or how to convert your payments from Euro to another currency? Wise is here to help us convert outgoing or incoming payments \n\nGot questions about your [Wise transfer](https://together.bunq.com/d/5149-what-is-wise-and-how-do-i-send-international-payments-with-it/2)? Check out the most frequently asked questions below!\n\n\n## Why hasn't the money I sent arrived?\n\nIt can take a few days for the money to arrive on the recipient's account (usually up to 2 business days). If the money hasn’t arrived by the estimated delivery time, Wise can provide you with a PDF transfer receipt that can be used to locate the funds at the beneficiary bank.\n\n__________\n\n## How long will my transfer take?\n\nWise always moves your money as quickly as possible. When you set up a transfer you will see an estimate of how long it will take. This depends on two things:\n\n1. The country you’re sending money to.\n\nEvery currency and country is different. Converting your money can take a maximum of two working days, but this happens very rarely. The speed of your transfer depends on how quickly your recipient’s bank can process your money.\n\n2. The time you made the transfer.\n\nWise handles your money during normal banking hours. Times also may vary if the country you’re sending money to has a national holiday.\n__________\n\n## Can I change my recipient’s bank details?\n\nThe recipient's details can only be changed up until the point that Wise has paid out your money. After your money has been paid out, the recipient's details can no longer be changed.\n\nYou can get in touch with Wise at bunq@wise.com or contact them via chat or phone [here](https://wise.com/contact). Remember to quote your Wise ID (shown on your payment in the bunq app) when you contact Wise.\n__________\n\n## Can I reverse or cancel a completed transfer?\n\nAll transfers completed by Wise are final and Wise cannot reverse or recall payments.\n\nWise does not have the ability to be involved in disputes between senders and recipients, so we strongly recommend you know and trust the person or business you are sending money to.\n\nOnce funds have been sent to a recipient's account and are marked as complete, transfers are final.\n\n---\n\n## Can I cancel my transfer? \n\nYou can’t personally cancel a transfer, but if you get in touch with Wise support they can cancel the transfer for you. Keep in mind the transfer can only be canceled up until the point Wise pays out your funds. Once the money has been sent to the recipient, it’s not possible to cancel the transfer anymore.\n\n---\n\n## What are the fees?\n\nThe fees depend on the currency and the amount you’re sending. Before making the payment, the fees will be shown on your screen. The payment fees are paid directly to Wise.\n\n---\n\n## I want to cancel the transfer I did, how do I do that?\n\nIf you want to cancel the payment because the other account isn’t reachable, you’ll need to settle this with the receiver or their bank.\n\n---\n\n## I got an error message \"The item you requested could not be found\", what should I do?\n\nYou get this error when making a Wise payment from a connected account you're not the owner of. Make sure to make the transfer from a personal sub-account which you own \n\n---\n\n## I got an error message ““Error: the smallest amount a recipient can get is 10 RPL/any other currency.”, what should I do?\n\nWhen you start to make a payment using Wise and you stop typing after 0.5 seconds, the amount already entered will be registered in the backend and you may receive the error regarding “the smallest amount a recipient can get is 10 RPL/any other currency”.\n\nThis isn’t a bug but simply how the system is set up. Therefore, you can continue entering the amount you want to transfer by dismissing the error.\n\n---\n\n## I’m stuck in a loop where I have to log in both the bunq app and Wise over again, what should I do?\n\nIn this case,  you can check auto logout. If it’s set to 0 seconds, the app first connects with Wise and\nthen redirects to the bunq app but forgets about the Wise connection. Therefore it starts from\nscratch, which causes the loop. You can simply change your auto logout settings and set them to a different (higher) metric. \n\n---\n\n## Can I make Wise transfers as a Connect?\n\nIt's not possible to make a Wise payment from a Connect account. This has to do with the limitations on the side of Wise. Your bunq account is linked to your personal Wise account and while on our side, we do offer a Connect feature, this isn’t possible on the side of Wise.\n\n__________\n\n## Need further help? \n\nIf you are looking for more information about the currency you're sending to, check [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/5185)!\n\nIf you need to get in touch with bunq support about your transfer, you can contact [Private Matters](https://www.bunq.com/link/support).\n\nIf you need to get in touch with Wise, you can email them at bunq@wise.com or contact them via chat or phone [here](https://wise.com/contact). Remember to always quote your Wise ID (shown on your payment in the bunq app) whenever you contact Wise.\n\n*Keep in mind that the above only applies to outgoing transfers. Incoming transfers must be received in euros, so feel free to  use Wise to help you with the currency conversion by checking out [their site]( https://transferwise.com/nl/) .*\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [How do I send transfers with Wise?](https://together.bunq.com/d/5149)\n- [Wise Currencies](https://together.bunq.com/d/5185)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "How does AutoVAT work?\n\n\n\nHey bunqers \n\nOur commitment to business owners is to continue to build a business banking platform that saves your most precious asset: your time.  \n\nNow you can automatically have your VAT ready when the tax man comes around - for both **incoming and outgoing payments!** \n\n### How does incoming AutoVAT work?\n\nYou finish painting the house for your client. \n\nYour client pays you for your work and you receive €121,00, including VAT. By enabling incoming VAT, €21,00 will automatically be set aside in your dedicated AutoVAT Bank Account. No extra effort from your side required!\n\n### How does outgoing AutoVAT work?\n\nImagine you own a house-painting business. You need to buy paint to complete a project for your client. \n\nIf you buy €42 worth of paint (which has a VAT of 9% in the Netherlands) to renovate the house, €3,78 will then be taken out of your AutoVAT Bank Account and added to your main Bank Account automatically.\n\n## How do both VATs work together?\n\nIncoming and outgoing VAT will now both be taken into account. In relation to the scenario above, you’ll now have a balance of **€17,22** (€21,00 - €3,78) in your dedicated AutoVAT Bank Account.\n\n## How does the VAT Bank Account work?\n\nEach time a payment is received, the VAT percentage of it is automatically set aside to the VAT Bank Account. This is referred to as incoming or received VAT, which is the VAT collected from customers.\n\nWhen a payment is made to another business, the VAT part of that payment, is reclaimed from the dedicated VAT account. This is where things become magical; based on who you’re paying, we detect how much VAT is due for that payment and automatically reclaim it from your VAT account. This is known as outgoing or reclaimed VAT. \n\nAt the end of the quarter, the amount due to the government is calculated as the difference between the incoming and outgoing VAT.\n\n## Do I need to apply the Local VAT rate manually?\n\nbunq has determined the VAT rates for different payment categories across various countries. Now, the appropriate local VAT rate is automatically applied to all your expenses. The VAT will be set on your payments based on the following:\n\n- **Outgoing payments** - AutoVAT automatically adjusts VAT rates depending on the recipient of the payment and the VAT in the country you live in.\n\n- **Incoming payments - when receiving funds, the VAT rate of your business is being applied\n\nHowever, when you make payments to tax authorities, both incoming and outgoing payments will have a 0% VAT rate applied.\n\n## How is VAT calculated in general?\n\nVAT is always calculated on the *before-VAT-value*.  For this example:\n\nUsing  **21% as VAT percentage**.\n\n- If you sell something for €100,- (without VAT), you'll have to pay €100,- x 21% = €21,- as VAT, meaning that the buyer pays you €121.\n- Now €21,- (the VAT value) of €121 (the total paid value) does not equal 21% but 17,36%. This is correct.\n\nTo calculate the VAT you should: \n\n- Divide the value including VAT by 1 + fraction of VAT percentage. \n- In this example that is €121 / 1,21 = €100 \n- Meaning €21,- is VAT as this is the difference.\n\nOf course, depending on the VAT percentage, you should divide by a different value to get the amount without VAT:\n\n- 9% it's 1,09  \n- 21% it's 1,21\n\nNow, if this does all sound complicated for you, look no further, because this is the feature you've been looking for. \n\n## How do I set it up in the bunq app?\n\nFurther information on how to set up your AutoVAT can be found [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/14717).\n\n## How can I see my AutoVAT Overview?\n\nIn the Budgeting tab, you’ll be able to see your AutoVAT Overview for each quarter. Inside you’ll see clear sections for:\n\n- Incoming VAT you’ve received\n- Outgoing VAT you’ve paid\n- Net VAT you need to pay for the quarter\n\n\n## Good to know\n\n* You can only reclaim the VAT on a payment once. The event will indicate whether the VAT was already reclaimed or not;\n* When the balance in your Bank Account is insufficient for an outgoing AutoVAT, the VAT amount will not be moved to the Bank Account you're paying from.;\n* The VAT amount will be moved from the AutoVAT account, towards the account you paid from. You **can't change** where to send the reclaimed AutoVAT. This is because the amount that comes in already includes the VAT, so we first have to calculate back to the amount without VAT.\n- You can have only one active AutoVAT Bank Account a time\n- If you make an inside transfer from your Bank Account to another Bank Account of yours, you won't trigger an AutoVAT calculation\n- You can share the AutoVAT Bank Account with other people via [Connect](https://together.bunq.com/d/1982)\n-  When you set up the feature, it'll automatically select all of your Bank Accounts. You can change this in the settings of the Bank Account you want to remove. \n-  Keep in mind that AutoVat doesn't work retrospectively - this means that your VAT will be calculated only for payments which were processed after the feature was activated. \n\n## FAQs\n\n- **Who can use AutoVAT?**\n\nAuto VAT is available for all bunq Easy Money and Easy Green business users .\n\n- **My company receives payments where no VAT is applied on the bill. How can I arrange that with AutoVAT?**\n\nThe best way to arrange that is to use two different bank accounts for receiving the payments:\n\na) You can have one account where all the companies from your country pay you, and that can be enabled for saving AutoVAT.\n\nb) Then you can have a bank account for companies outside your country to pay you, and that can be disabled for AutoVAT \n\n- **Do I get interest on my AutoVAT account?**\n\nYes, you get interest on your AutoVAT Savings account! Further information  on MassInterest can be found [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/8298).\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [How do I set up AutoVat?](https://together.bunq.com/d/14717)\n\nWant to learn more?

Healthier cash flow management! Outgoing (electronic) invoices can get paid faster by including payment request in your invoices (through bunq.me) \n3. No more cash & paper based expense submissions! Employee expenses can be better managed with bunq cards (through setting budgets on cards) \n4. Be in control of your finances in real-time! All transactions made, are automatically uploaded in real-time in your accounting environment (through Connect) \n5. No more unpleasant tax surprises & financial tax problems!

    "source_text" : " Wie man Betrug erkennt und sicher bleibt\n\n## Wie man Betrug erkennt und sicher bleibt\n\nHallo, bunqers!  \nWie du weißt, nimmt bunq die Sicherheit deiner persönlichen Daten sehr ernst.  Wir haben bereits einige Tipps mitgeteilt, wie du dich und dein Geld hier schützen kannst. Allerdings dachten wir, dass es hilfreich sein könnte, weitere Tipps zu geben, damit du Betrug besser erkennen kannst.\n\n## Phishing\nWas ist Phishing? Phishing ist ein Versuch von Betrügern, deine persönlichen Daten wie Kennwörter oder Sicherheitsdaten abzurufen. Die Betrüger geben sich oft als vertrauenswürdige Organisation aus, indem sie gefälschte Webseiten verwenden, die wie legitime Webseiten aussehen. Das allgemeine Layout sowie der Link sind meistens fast genau gleich. Diese Webseiten sind sehr gut darin, dich zu überzeugen, dass sie eine echte Mail von (zum Beispiel) deiner Bank oder einem Online-Zahlungsabwickler senden, obwohl es sich tatsächlich um einen Betrug handelt.\n\nWenn du eine Mail oder andere Nachrichten erhältst, die den normalen Nachrichten von bunq ähneln, in denen du aufgefordert bist, einem Link zu folgen und dich anzumelden oder deine Anmeldecodes oder andere Sicherheitsinformationen weiterzugeben, befolge bitte diese Anweisungen nicht.\n\nbunq würde niemals per Telefon (wir verwenden keine Telefonate als Kommunikationsmittel), per E-Mail, SMS, WhatsApp oder in irgendeiner Form von sozialen Medien nach deinen Anmeldedaten oder Sicherheitsfunktionen fragen.\nWenn du einer Website nicht vertraust oder dir nicht sicher bist, kannst du jederzeit Tools wie dieses verwenden, um dies zu überprüfen. \nHier ein Tipp: Wenn es den Anschein macht, als sei die Webseite vor kurzem registriert, kann dies ein Hinweis darauf sein, dass die Website gefälscht ist. Weitere Informationen findest du im folgenden Thema.\n\n## Old-school Phishing\nDies geschieht, wenn du deine PIN an einem Geldautomaten oder an einer Zahlstelle eingibst. Bitte stelle sicher, dass dich niemand beobachtet und du deine PIN immer verbirgst, währenddessen du sie eingibst. Bewahre anschließend deinen Passcode sicher.\n\n## WhatsApp Betrug\nWhatsApp-Betrug ist eine Form von Betrug, bei der jemand vorgibt, dich zu kennen und dich über eine WhatsApp-Nachricht darum bittet, ihm bei der Zahlung einer Rechnung zu helfen. In der Regel gelten folgende Eigenschaften:\n\nDie \"Person, die du kennst\" hat eine neue Nummer und kontaktiert dich über WhatsApp.\n\nSie bittet dich darum, ihr zu helfen, indem du eine Rechnung für sie bezahlst.\n\nNormalerweise ist die Person in Eile, die Rechnung muss schnell bezahlt werden;\n\nSie kann oder will nicht auf andere Weise als Whatsapp mit dir kommunizieren.\n\nWenn dich jemand auffordert, Geld zu überweisen oder eine vorhandene Rechnung zu bezahlen, wende dich bitte immer über andere Kommunikationsmittel außerhalb von Whatsapp an diese Person. Wenn du diese Person nicht erreichen kannst, überweise bitte kein Geld.\nWie könntest du helfen, diese Art von Betrügereien zu stoppen? Wenn der Betrüger einen Link bereitgestellt hat, solltest du die IBAN oder den Link der Polizei und der entsprechenden Bank melden.\n\n## Gefälschte Zahlungsanfragen\nWenn du eine Zahlungsanforderung erhältst, überprüfe immer die Echtheit der Webseite, zu welcher der Link führt. Oft verwenden Betrüger gefälschte Internetseiten, die der normalen Zahlungsumgebung einer Bank sehr ähnlich sehen, allerdings ist die Website eine gefälschte. Die Informationen, die du in diese Zahlungsanforderung eingibst, sind für die Betrüger direkt sichtbar und können für den Zugriff auf dein Bankkonto verwendet werden.\n\nGebe niemals deine Daten ein, wenn du dem Zahlungslink oder der Person, die dir die Zahlungsanforderung sendet, nicht vertraust.\n\n## Marketplace fraud\nEs gibt viele Male, in denen man den gesuchten Artikel auf Gebrauchtwaren Webseiten findet. Das ist toll! Gebrauchtwaren sind billiger und die Wiederverwendung von Produkten trägt zu einer grüneren Welt bei. Leider liefert manchmal die Person das Produkt nicht, nachdem du schon bezahlt hast.\n\nWoran erkennt man solche Betrüger? Zunächst möchten wir betonen, dass falls klingt als sei es zu gut um wahr zu sein, liegt es normalerweise daran, dass es nicht echt ist. Überprüfe immer den Marktwert des Produkts, das du kaufen möchtest. Wenn der Preis des angebotenen Produkts zu niedrig ist, kann dies ein Zeichen dafür sein, dass ein Betrüger am Werk ist.\n\n## Werde kein Goldesel!\nWenn sich jemand an dich wendet und um Zugang zu deinem Bankkonto bittet oder Geld über dein Bankkonto überweisen möchte, folge dieser Aufforderung niemals, egal wie vielversprechend sie klingt!\n\nHier ein Beispiel: Jemand kontaktiert dich über soziale Medien oder Freunde und verspricht dir einen Geldbetrag. Die Person verspricht dir dieses Geld, wenn du Geld für sie überweist oder wenn sie dein Bankkonto für einige Tage nutzen kann. Sie wird dir sagen, dass es kein Risiko gibt und dass es wirklich leicht verdientest Geld ist.\n\nEs ist sehr wahrscheinlich, dass dein Bankkonto für kriminelle Aktivitäten verwendet wird, für welche du (strafrechtlich) haftbar gemacht werden würdest. Dies kann zur Folge haben, dass du keine Bankkonten eröffnen, keine Hypothek aufnehmen oder keinen Kredit erhalten kannst und möglicherweise könnte ein Strafverfahren eingeleitet werden.\n\nBitte beachte hier, dass falls etwas klingt als sei es zu gut um wahr zu sein liegt dies normalerweise daran, dass es nicht wahr ist.\nWeitere Informationen zu money mules, findest du auf dieser Webseite der niederländischen Polizei.\n\n## Was ist zu tun, wenn du zu einem Betrugsopfer wirst oder Betrug vermutest?\nÜberprüfe dein Bankkonto regelmäßig und lese deine Bankpost nach Erhalt immer schnell. Wenn du Opfer von Betrügern geworden bist, wende dich sofort an deine Bank.\n\nWenn du einen Betrugsverdacht hast, informiere bitte deine Bank über den Verdacht.\nDas Formular zur Meldung von mutmaßlichem Betrug oder Betrug bei bunq ist [hier](https://www.bunq.com/report) zu finden.\n\n___\n## Möchtest du mehr erfahren?\nDu kannst dir gerne unsere bunq Wissensdatenbank unter https://go.bunq.com/link/knowledge anschauen. \n",

Once the invitation is accepted, your kid should simply follow the flow. Once the invitation process is done, you'll have full access to your child's account.\n\n___\n\n ## What do you need to open an account?\n\nAll you need to open an account for your child will be their Tax ID.  After registration, you have the option to add an email address or phone number to your child’s account so they can log in from their device. To do so, follow the  steps mentioned below:\n\n1. Go to Profile\n2. Tap on Personal Information\n3. Change the details\n4. Edit or update information accordingly.\nSelect Done\n\n\n\n___\n\n## Why Isn’t my child’s account verified?\n\nIn case your last name and your child's last name don't match, we would require a document that proves your legal guardianship. This could be any of the following:\n\n- Birth certification\n- Adoption documents\n- Court order establishing custody of the child\n- Court order establishing legal guardianship\n- Official documents issued by the Government or Embassy that clearly state the name of the guardian, name of the minor and the relationship between the two. \n\n—--\n\n## How to give your child access from their device?\n\n1.

The child can choose any of our plans (More info on our plans [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/3892).\n- You as a parent have full overview and access to your child's account.\n- Both parents can have access to the child's account if they have Easy Bank, Easy Money and Easy Green. \n- No minimum age is required.

    "source_text" : " ¿Cómo resuelvo un pago fallido con tarjeta?\n\n\n\nHay algunas cosas a las que debes prestar atención si estás intentando pagar con tu tarjeta bunq y no se acepta el pago. A continuación encontrarás una lista de lo que debes verificar si falla el pago de tu tarjeta.\n\n---\n\n## Si realizaste un pago con tarjeta para el cual tuviste que ingresar tu código PIN:\n\n**PIN incorrecto**  \nSi el pago se rechaza porque se ingresó un PIN incorrecto, la pantalla del terminal y tu aplicación bunq te lo indicarán. En esta situación, debes [cambiar el PIN de tu tarjeta](https://go.bunq.com/link/set-pin) que se actualizará instantáneamente en nuestro sistema. Sin embargo, si intentas volver a pagar inmediatamente después, es posible que algunas terminales no puedan leer el código PIN actualizado en el chip de tu tarjeta y te muestren el mismo mensaje de error. En esta situación, debes realizar una transacción en un cajero automático para asegurarte de que el código PIN de tu tarjeta también se actualice en el chip de tu tarjeta.\n\n*Nota: Si ingresaste el código PIN incorrecto 3 veces, deberás [restablecerlo](https://www.together.bunq.com/d/3980) en la aplicación bunq para completar el pago.*\n\n**El país no está permitido**  \nCuando viajas, puede suceder que se rechacen los pagos de tu tarjeta porque el país que estás visitando aún no está habilitado. Puedes cambiarlo fácilmente agregándolo a tu lista de países habilitados o bien, habilitando pagos con tarjeta en todo el mundo. Puedes ver cómo hacer esto [aquí](https://together.bunq.com/d/2815).\n\n**La tarjeta no está activa**  \nPara que se aprueben, los pagos con tarjeta deben hacerse con una tarjeta activa. Esto significa que si acabas de ordenar tu tarjeta y aún no la has activado o si tu tarjeta está temporalmente congelada, el pago no se realizará. En tales casos, primero debes [activar tu tarjeta](https://together.bunq.com/d/3985) antes de intentar pagar nuevamente.\n\n**Límite diario excedido**   \nPara proteger tu dinero, hemos establecido un límite diario predeterminado de [€ 1,000 por día que se puede ajustar hasta € 50,000 por día](https://together.bunq.com/d/6635). Siempre puedes cambiarlo siguiendo los pasos presentados en este [enlace](https://together.bunq.com/d/4757).\n\n\n**Retiros de efectivo**  \nSi no puedes retirar dinero en un cajero automático, primero debes asegurarte de no haber alcanzado tu [límite diario de € 500](https://together.bunq.com/d/4757-changing-my-daily -card-limit) establecido para todas las tarjetas bunq y ten en cuenta que el cajero automático también puede tener un límite propio.

Cuando un [país está habilitado](https://together.bunq.com/d/2815-can-i-use-my-bunq-card-in-foreign-countries/9) en la configuración de su tarjeta, se aplicará el [límite sin contacto local](https://together.bunq.com/d/17570-travel-with-ease-contactless-limits-improvements)\n\nPuedes encontrar más información sobre los límites diarios en este [enlace](https://together.bunq.com/d/6635).\n\n**Necesitamos un PIN para este pago**  \nSi se rechaza tu pago sin contacto y recibes el mensaje de error \"PIN no recibido\", significa que necesitamos tu código PIN para esta transacción.

Esto significa que si acabas de pedir tu tarjeta y aún no la has activado o si tu tarjeta está temporalmente congelada, el pago no se realizará. En estos casos, primero debes [activar tu tarjeta] (https://together.bunq.com/d/3985) antes de intentar pagar nuevamente.\n\n---\n\n## Si realizaste un pago en línea:\n\n**Detalles incorrectos de la tarjeta**  \nSi estás tratando de pagar en línea con tu tarjeta bunq y se rechaza el pago, lo primero que debes hacer es verificar nuevamente los detalles de tu tarjeta y asegurarte de haber ingresado el número de tarjeta correcto, la fecha de vencimiento y tu código CVC actual, especialmente si tienes la [función CVC giratoria](https://together.bunq.com/d/3019) activada.\n\nPuedes encontrar los detalles de tu tarjeta [aquí](https://go.bunq.com/link/cvc) o en la aplicación en **Tarjetas**> **Selecciona la tarjeta correcta** > **Detalles de la tarjeta**\n\n**El comerciante está bloqueado** \n Si un pago al mismo comerciante falló más de 3 veces en una hora, bloquearemos todas las transacciones a este comerciante durante 60 minutos por razones de seguridad.

Furthermore fees for balances over €1,000,000 are reduced by 50%.\n\nAt bunq we have the highest safety concerns for your money and therefore store large parts of it at the European Central Bank (ECB). Since the ECB has decided to stop charging money for deposits, we’ve immediately responded by adjusting our safekeeping fees accordingly, so that you can keep your funds secure for less \n\n**Therefore, as of 1st of October 2022, the following pricing is in effect:**\n\n- For balances up to €1,000,000, we'll no longer charge any safekeeping fees.\n- For balances over €1,000,000, the safekeeping fee is significantly reduced by 50% to €0.03 per day per €1,000 (rounded down). As before it only applies to your balance above €1,000,000.\n\n**Important note**:  As of December 1, 2022, bunq will no longer be charging safekeeping fee at all! More will be announced soon  \n\n## Example for accounts with balance below €1,000,000 \n\n- If you have less than **€1,000,000 in your bunq account** (total of all Bank Accounts): **there's NO safekeeping fee**, since this is below the minimum amount for it. \n\n## Example for accounts with balance above €1,000,000 \n\n**If you have €1,100,000 in your bunq account:** \n\n - Your first €1,000,000 would be with no safekeeping fee.\n - For every €1,000 above €1,000,000 you’re charged €0.03/per day. In this case - 100 x 0.03 = €3.00/per day.\n - This makes your safekeeping fee  a total of €3.00/per day.\n\nYou can find more detailed information about our safekeeping fee as well as the pricing of other services in our [pricing sheet](https://www.bunq.com/en/pricing-sheet). \n\n## Related topics \n\n- [What is the European Central Bank (ECB)?](https://together.bunq.com/d/4953)\n\n\nWant to learn more?

As always, we're here to make your banking experience as clear and straightforward as possible \n\n### What does this status mean?\n\n- **For outgoing card payments**\n\nFor outgoing card payments, this status means that the card payment has been successful, and the merchant has already collected the money from us.\n\nBecause of that, if you need a refund for this payment, your first step would be to contact the merchant directly. If for some reason you can’t get a refund from the merchant, you can then contact us through our [Support center](https://together.bunq.com/d/40046) and ask us to reverse the payment.\n\nKeep in mind that we’ll need to see proof of your communication with the merchant regarding the refund before we can reverse the payment for you.\n\n- **For incoming card payments**\n\nFor incoming card payments, this status means that the payment was successfully received to your account. Therefore the status of the payment changes to “Received”. \n\nIn the sub-account’s payment history you can see all the statuses of the payment in separate events in chronological order. \n\n## Related topics \n\n- [How do I solve a failed card payment?](https://together.bunq.com/d/24142)\n- [Issue with card payments](https://together.bunq.com/d/48481)\n- [What does the Expired status mean?](https://together.bunq.com/d/54816)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "bunq Tips - Experience the comfort of Instant Payments!\n\nHello bunqers! \n\nIt’s Sunday, which means we are about to share another bunq Tip with you to make your experience with us even better  Let’s talk about instant payments!\n__________________\n## A little background\nWe've been offering instant payments between bunq users since 2015. In 2017 the European Payment Council (EPC) announced that 600 banks across Europe will offer Instant Payment support.  This means that sending a SEPA transfer will arrive within seconds at the other party, if they participate in the EPC Instant Payment system too. Even if it is in the evening, weekend, or holidays! Naturally, we jumped at the opportunity to be a part of this already a few years ago.\n\nWe chose to participate in the EU Instant Payment System because...well, we are an international bank based in the Netherlands. Next to that, there are instant payments with way more other banks than solely the Dutch banks. Other Dutch banks are slowly joining us on the same path of user-oriented innovation and ensuring cross-border availability, but most of them are not there yet. Instead, they integrated the Dutch Instant Payment System in spring 2019. Are you ready for the Dutch banks to join us? Yes? Us too! Because it allows you to do easy banking with family, friends, and colleagues residing in other countries!\n\nLet’s discuss some of the details of instant payments. It’s good to know that the Instant Payments system supports payments up to €15.000. Everything above that amount will be sent as a normal SEPA transfer, meaning this payment will arrive within 1-2 working days. Be sure to check [this topic](https://together.bunq.com/d/4295-when-will-i-receive-my-payment/12) to see when your payment will arrive. Don’t forget you can also top up your account by using [iDeal](https://together.bunq.com/d/2933) (in the Netherlands) or [Bancontact](https://together.bunq.com/d/25248-bancontact-for-top-ups-and-bunq-me) (in Belgium).\n\n________________\nAs you can see, bunq is ready for every bank in Europe to participate in the EU Instant Payment system, so that all your payments will arrive instantly. Until that happens, here’s a little tip to make sure you have a carefree banking experience: turn on your [notification settings](https://together.bunq.com/d/2901-how-can-i-change-my-notification-settings) in the app, this way you can get real-time notifications of all your sent and received payments so you'll always stay up to date. \n\nLast but not least: find an updated list of all participating banks [here](https://www.ebaclearing.eu/services/instant-payments/participants).\n\nEach day more users are joining us on this great adventure, making banking more and more convenient to make your life easier!\n___________________________\n## Not a bunq user yet?\nGet your account in less than 5 minutes [here](https://app.adjust.com/is3en2u?redirect=https://www.bunq.com/signup) ",

    "source_text" : "I received a garnishment on my German account \n\nHey bunqers \n\n\n### What's a garnishment?\n\nIf you have an outstanding debt to an individual, institution, or entity (also known as a creditor), they may obtain a court order to recover the money you owe. This process is called garnishment. According to German law, a garnishment allows the garnishor (the party that’s owed money) to legally force the garnishee (the debtor) to fulfill their financial obligations to the relevant creditor.\n\n## What happens if your German account received a garnishment?\n\n#### Step 1. We’ll let you know\n\nWhen we’re contacted by a creditor (a bailiff, an institution, a Creditor or acreditor’s representative) and receive the administrative enforceable documents from them, we put the bank account in question under garnishment by temporarily freezing your monetary account(s)  and inform you right away in the app.\n\nTo check your received messages from bunq you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to Profile\n2. Click on “See More” under Activity\n3. Check out the messages sent there\n\n#### Step 2. Seizure\n\nFirst, we must have received a garnishment request by the creditor accompanied with the court order. While we’re processing the garnishment, we temporarily freeze your monetary account(s). We then transfer the funds from your account up to the amount of the debt into a special bunq intermediary account where they will be reserved for the bailiff or directly send the funds to them (if that’s stated in the order). \n\nIn case the available funds on your account(s) are enough to settle the whole debt, we’ll reactivate your account(s) after the transfer and you can use them as usual .\n\nHowever, if at the time of processing the garnishment there aren’t enough funds on the account to cover the requested amount, we will have to keep the account(s) frozen. We will also have to reserve any incoming funds up to the amount of the debt that are credited to the account after the garnishment was applied. When new funds are available, we will immediately inform the creditor of the newly seized amount. \n\n#### Step 3. Unfreezing your Bank Accounts\n\nWhen the procedure above is completed, or we receive an explicit request from the creditor, we'll unfreeze your monetary account(s). Then you can use your bunq account as usual.\n\nIf the debt is decreased or you have settled it by means other than bunq, we must receive an official written statement from the creditor where it’s stated that the proceedings were completed and bunq is at liberty to release the monetary accounts or return any seized funds.\n\n## When will my account be unblocked?\n\nThis depends on the instructions of the bailiff. To get your account unblocked please contact the bailiff.\n\n## Is there an administration fee for a garnishment?\n\nBy German law, bunq is required to process every garnishment. Since this is fully regulated by the German law, we process garnishment(s) free of charge.\n\n## I have another question about a garnishment placed on my account. Who do I contact?\n\nWe've shared the available details about the garnishment, including the file number and the creditor's name, in the garnishment announcement. For more specific advice and assistance, it would be best to reach out to the bailiff directly. They'll be able to provide you with more detailed information.\n\n## When will my garnishment finish?\n\nAs soon as a judge ruled on the garnishment, we’ll receive the verdict and when we have the needed transfer order, we’ll immediately process all needed payments.\n\n##How can I appeal?\n\nAs a third-party, we don't handle objections or other requests related to the garnishment. These matters are managed by the institution or the bailiff who placed the garnishment. If you have any further questions, it’ll be best to contact the bailiff about them.\n\n## What if I have more than one garnishment?\n\nWhen you have multiple garnishments your account will be blocked until all of the garnishment proceedings are completed.\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [I received a garnishment on my Dutch account ](https://together.bunq.com/d/23452)\n- [I received a garnishment on my French account ](https://together.bunq.com/d/55120) \n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "Anti-Fraud Guide: Spoofing - The dynamic ways of scamming nowadays, explained  \n\nHey bunqers \n\nWe strive to keep you and your money safe so that you can have the best banking experience ever. Although there are things that are out of our control, we want to keep you updated with the latest phishing and spoofing trends. You can check all the info you need regarding phishing and in particular spoofing below \n\n❗️ **You have suspicions regarding a phishing attempt? [Report it directly to us in our report form](https://www.bunq.com/report) and we'll investigate for you right away** ❗\n\n**Important Note:** Always be careful with your personal data and make sure to never share it with third parties. bunq would never contact you outside of the bunq app or its official channels and ask you to install any third party softwares, give your credentials, or any personal information (phone number, email address, security code, card number, IBAN, etc.)\n\n## What’s spoofing?\n\nSpoofing involves disguising the source of communication to make it appear as if it comes from a trustworthy entity when, in reality, it comes from an imposter. Scammers have been known to trick their victims by sending fraudulent links via SMS, Whatsapp or email. These messages or calls are made to seem as if they’re coming explicitly from our bunq telephone number.\n\n**❗bunq won't call you via the phone. If you have any doubts of the message/call's legitimacy, please don't provide any sensitive data to the respective person and contact us through the in-app chat or use support@bunq.com.**\n\n## What types of Spoofing are most common?\n\n#### Fake bunq phone calls ☎️\n\nFraudsters can call you and pretend they are bunq employees that want to help you by masking the number they're calling you from. By doing so, you get a call from an unknown number, or it may look like we’re calling you from our own 24/7 emergency hotline +31208083666. They may ask you to follow a link, confirm or give away personal information, download  softwares (such as TeamViewer, AnyDesk, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), etc), make  transfers, etc. All these actions could lead to the loss of access to your account(s) and your funds.\n\n惡 Examples of tactics used by criminals on the phone:\n\n- Use the name of real bunq employees and ask you to check this employee's account on LinkedIn, to make sure they work for bunq.\n- “Inform” you that suspicious activities were detected on your account, such as a new device being added and/or suspicious transactions being started.\n- Convince you to follow their instructions immediately to keep your account safe, and pressure you to take quick action.\n- Following complex processes to create a sense of credibility, such as transferring your call to other “departments”, asking you to save procedure number, etc.\n\n❗Please be informed that we only use this number to **receive** calls from our users who need urgent assistance. **bunq will never call you.** If any suspicious activity is detected on your account, we'll apply additional restrictions and/or contact you through the bunq app.\n\nIf you receive a phone call from someone pretending to be us, please report it [here](https://www.bunq.com/report/phishing).\n\n\n#### Fraudulent SMS messages \n\nScammers are quite witty and creative in the ways they use to get your money. To get your attention \nand worry you enough so you follow their instructions without a second thought, they can send a wave of fake messages seemingly from bunq using alarming words and phrases such as 'Suspicious device login', 'Verification required', 'Block', etc. They will also include a link, seemingly for your convenience, that you need to simply follow in order to take quick action and protect yourself.\n\nIf you follow the link, additional instructions follow via different channels - on a fake website, or via phone call/audio call, or text message. For example, you can receive an SMS from a Belgian mobile phone, while the fraudsters then call from a Dutch number. At some point you may be asked to scan a QR code and enter your bunq login details. A text may look like this:\n\n\n\nThe fraudsters will pretend they need you to do this in order to ‘secure your account’, falsely pretending to be members of the bunq team in order to  gain access to your account, as well as all the information and assets in it.\n\n#### Fake emails \n\nSimilarly tactics from SMS fraud can be applied via email. A situation of urgency is insinuated and they copy bunq design and style on the email, in order to increase your chances to believe that email is legit. **Always check whether the email is sent from one of our official emails for user communication.**\n\nIf you've received an email and you're not sure if it's spoofing, check out the actual domains we use to communicate with you through email:\n\n- @bunq.com - This is our primary domain and is used for transactional emails.\n- @update.bunq.com - This subdomain is dedicated to sending bunq Update invites and general announcements.\n- @hello.bunq.com - This subdomain is used for marketing communications.\n- @review@bunq.com - This domain is used when we require extensive information and request additional documents from you.\n\n## Keeping you safe\n\nIf you're still wondering how you can avoid phishing and spoofing scams, you can find out some of our tips [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/54498).\n\nIf you receive a suspicious phone call, SMS, or email from somebody who tries to persuade you they represent bunq, be sure to alert us using our [report form](https://www.bunq.com/report/phishing).\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [What’s phishing and how to recognize it?](https://together.bunq.com/d/54498) \n- [How to recognize fraudulent verification requests on Marktplaats?](https://together.bunq.com/d/54500) \n- [Phishing scams: Belastingdienst, MijnOverheid and MijnDigid](https://together.bunq.com/d/26118)  \n- [I was scammed.

PSD2 was created as a way to get banks to open up their systems so that new fin-techs could start using them to build solutions. \n\n*If you would like to read about the Revised Payment Service Directive, please check out this article from [Evry](https://www.evry.com/en/news/articles/psd2-the-directive-that-will-change-banking-as-we-know-it/)*\n\n At bunq, we've always believed in innovation and transparency. That's why we opened up our API in 2017. This showed great success, but PSD2 has required our API to go through some changes.\n\nWe've taken the first step in this update by releasing a new sandbox environment. This lets anyone test and provide feedback for the new way our API will allow Account Information Service Providers (AISP) and Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISP) to interact with bunq accounts.\n\n## Authentication update \n\nOne of the major changes incorporated in the sandbox update is the new approach of how banks must authenticate payment service providers, financial business administration solutions, checkout systems, budgeting tools, invoicing software and any other AISP/PISP.\n\n## OAuth flows\n\nWe will continue following the Dynamic Client Registration specification and the current OAuth flow. The only change is the scope of sandbox operations that are allowed through OAuth (since permissions now depend on the role of the TPP).\n\n#### AISPs can read account information such as the following:\n\n- legal name\n- nationality\n- IBAN\n- card validity data\n- account balance\n\n#### Transactions PISPs are allowed to do the following:\n\n- read account information\n- initiate payments\n- confirm whether there are sufficient funds available on the user's account to cover a payment initiated by the TPP. \n\n## Connecting to the bunq PSD2-compliant sandbox\n\nBy connecting to Sandbox, anyone can start exploring the new bunq API. Just follow the 5 steps below:\n\n1. Create a test PSD2 certificate.\n2. Get a PSD2 user by following the PSD2 authentication flow.\n3. Register an OAuth application.\n4. Create an additional sandbox user that will play the role of an end user.\n5. Authenticate the user via OAuth.\n6. Start testing!\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [bunq API](https://doc.bunq.com/)\n- [How to find bunq API object/field descriptions?](https://together.bunq.com/d/15728)\n- [Zapier integrations: automate your finances and start saving time](https://together.bunq.com/d/24343)\n\nWant to learn more?

As a result, in order to offer you the best product possible, without taking any risks, we partner with Currencycloud.\n\nThe way it works in essence is that your balance on your non-euro bunq accounts are technically held in a third-party bank account which isn’t sensitive to any credit-risks from our counter party.\nThis way, we ensure that your funds are taken care of with the best protection, regardless of the fact that they are not covered from the Dutch Deposit Guarantee Scheme.

Sometimes they need supporting information regarding these payments. If needed - you'll receive a notification regarding this and you'll asked to provide the needed information in the in-app chat ✅\n\nAfter receiving the requested information, our team forwards it to our payment provider partner.

    "source_text" : "bunq Tips - Easily accept B2B Direct Debits, without the need for any paperwork!\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nIf you’re a bunq Business user, you may have noticed other users asking about B2B SDD from time to time. Even though acronyms are an easy way to name things, it’s hard to remember all of them. But no worries, we’ve got you covered on this one! Get a beverage and let us tell you what B2B SDD is and how to use it step-by-step. Let’s begin! \n\n### What is B2B SDD?\n\nIt stands for Business to Business SEPA Direct Debits 珞 These are payments that companies can charge to your IBAN, usually for recurring payments, such as membership fees. \n\nFor example, you recently set up a new contract with your network provider, and they send you the monthly costs to your bunq account. However, you notice that they seem to have charged you a higher fee than you expected. Luckily, with bunq you can choose to approve or deny the Direct Debits that you receive. This means you're in full control and can always decide not to pay a direct debit.\n\n\n## How does it work?\n\nAs a rule, Direct Debits are set up like \"contracts\" using a paper form. The SDD issuer gives you the two copies of the papers to set up the B2B Direct Debit. You need to fill out one copy by entering [your bunq IBAN](https://together.bunq.com/d/2880-how-do-i-find-my-iban/5) and send it back to the SDD issuer. The other copy is usually for the bank, but since we're not a big fan of any paper form, we've integrated this in the app. We'll send you a push notification to authorize this request. You'll have the option to accept it (for one day). The contract is formed once you've accepted the request. If no action is taken before the indicated period, the Direct Debit will expire and w'ill automatically decline it. \n\nWe provide full freedom to you so you can make complete use of your account and any service you want to link to it.  \n\n- This feature is only available for [Business](https://together.bunq.com/d/1014-who-can-open-a-bunq-business-account/10) users\n- It's not possible to refund B2B Direct Debit, you need to contact the other party.\n- All future B2B Direct Debits will be accepted automatically from the same company\n\n\n## How does this work in the app?\n\nWhen you open the bunq app and load the Home screen, you'll see a pending event on the top of the screen. Simply click on it and accept/decline the payment. \n\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [How do I auto-accept direct debits?](https://together.bunq.com/d/49548)\n- [How can I pay direct debits with bunq?](https://together.bunq.com/d/1972)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "Is the bunq Metal Credit Card an official credit card?\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nYes! The bunq Metal Credit Card's an official credit card, but of course, we made sure that it works for you as it comes without the risk of falling into debt. \n\nThis allows you to use it to the full extent and acceptability of a normal credit card, without the possibility of financial burden. This means that you'll need to add money to your Metal Credit Card before you can use it for payments.\n\n**Important Note:** Starting from January 15, 2024, we'll no longer be providing our Metal Credit Card as part of our offerings. However, if you’re currently a Metal Credit Card holder and require a replacement, please be aware that the availability of replacement cards is limited.\n\n### What are the benefits? \n\nThe bunq Metal Credit Card is the best card option for worldwide traveling, as it gives you the best acceptance online and worldwide. With it, you get the overall usability of a credit card without the risk that comes along with credit.\n\nYou can use it when traveling for hotel reservations, car rentals and all other payments that require a deposit. This means larger merchant acceptance and more convenience on your holiday. The main difference is that it'll be accepted by merchants who only accept credit cards.\n\n---\n\n## How does the bunq Metal Credit Card work with deposits?  \n\nIf you want to use your bunq Metal Credit Card for a deposit, such as for a rental car or hotel room, the merchant will accept your card just like they would a traditional credit card. Since no credit is used when making the payment, the entire amount of the deposit will be deducted directly from your account at the time of purchase.\n\nThis means you need to have the available funds in your account when paying the deposit. Once the deposit is released, you'll then receive the funds back in your account and you won't risk having a negative balance or falling into debt.\n\nFor more info about the bunq Metal Credit Card, check out [this topic](https://together.bunq.com/d/23424-metal-card-how-does-it-work-and-how-can-i-order).\n\n---\n\n## Related Topics \n\n- [Metal Credit Card: How does it work and how can I order?](https://together.bunq.com/d/23424)\n- [What are my daily card, cash deposits and withdrawals limits?](https://together.bunq.com/d/6635-what-are-my-daily-card-cash-deposits-and-withdrawals-limits)\n- [How do offline PIN payments work?](https://together.bunq.com/d/4822-how-do-offline-pin-payments-work)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "Activities Tab ‍♀️\n\n\n\nHey bunqers \n\nEasily discover places recommended by your friends and recommend your favorite places in just one tap! Night out with your besties? Now you can also automatically track and easily split expenses with a group of friends. All of this from the same tab. Want to see how? Check out below.\n\n## What’s happening?\n\nThis section shows what is currently happening between you and your friends related to the Activities tab. You’ll see all the active Group Expenses, places you’ve visited and the places your friends have recommended. Each place will have the flag of the country the place is in!\n\n## Visited Places\n\nIn the Visited Places section you’ll find a map that will give you an overview of all the places you’ve visited and rated. You’ll also see your friends’ recommendations on the map.\n\n### How do I recommend a place to your friends? \n\nYou can effortlessly rate places where you make a payment and recommend them to your friends. When you make a payment at a place, you'll automatically get a notification to rate the place you've visited! If you visit the same place again, you'll be able to re-rate it! Once you open your Activity tab and tap on the \"You have X visits to review\" notification above the Map, you'll be able to rate by using  to like the place,  to dislike it and ⚪️ if you don't want to rate it. \n\nAlso, for every 10 places you've rated (no matter what rating you've left), you'll plant 1 tree  Once planted, you'll be able to find it in your Green Tab. \n\n### I’ve visited the same place a few times. Can I review each visit?\n\nYes, you can  You can review each visit from your Activities tab. If you’ve been to the same place a few times in a row, each visit will appear in your review queue, provided there’s at least 12 hours between each visit.\n\n### Want to discover your friends’ place recommendations? \n\n#### What’s Happening?\nWithin the Activities tab, you have the convenience of discovering all the fun things around you. Simply navigate to the \"What's Happening\" section and enjoy exploring places that your friends have listed and recommended.\n\n#### Tapping on Food / Drink / Fun\n\nUnder this section you can choose the place you’re looking for and explore the map. Search for a specific type of place you’re interested in visiting, look up for the person who recommended it, or even search based on the occasion for which it’s recommended. You can also choose the same from the suggestion box located just above the map.\n\nAnd don't stress about the map getting too cluttered - we've got you covered. When you're viewing the larger map, we show fewer recommendation pins to keep things neat and tidy. But here's the fun part - as you zoom in, you'll start to see more and more pins popping up, each one a recommended place just waiting for you to discover. \n\n#### Your friends’ recommendations\n\nWant to see all the cool places your friends recommend? Just tap on your friend’s name in the Activity tab and voila! All their recommendations will be right there for you.\n\n## Group Expenses \n\nThis feature will help you track group expenses automatically with just a tap. \n\nYou can create a Group Expense by tapping on “Auto-Track Group Expenses”. You can add payments manually, from your past transactions or automatically add them when you pay to split them with the group participants. Additionally, you can also set an automatic end date so you’re never bothered about ending the group expense manually.

    "source_text" : "Why was my Mastercard chargeback denied?\n\nHey bunqers! \n\nEver wondered why your chargeback was denied? This topic will give you more insights on how chargebacks are processed and the requirements that must be fulfilled \n\n### So, why was my Mastercard chargeback denied?\n\nFor the purpose of a successful chargeback submission to Mastercard, there are specific conditions we should meet, according to Mastercard’s rules and regulations. If your request doesn’t cover all the requirements, we have to deny your request. There are a few main reasons why your chargeback may be denied: \n\n## The payment is older than 120 days ⏳\n\nWhen a transaction you want to refund was settled more than 120 days ago, you’re not eligible for a chargeback, therefore the request won’t be processed further. \n\n## We’ve already submitted or denied a chargeback for this payment \n\nWhen a chargeback request is already processed, approved or denied, a following request for the same transaction can’t be initiated/processed again.\n\n## Over 15 fraud-related refund requests per card \n\nIf you request over 15 transactions which appear to be fraudulent (not authorized) with the same card, following Mastercard’s regulations, we’re obligated to deny any further request for this card. \n\n## You have a transaction history with the merchant 欄\n\nWhen you request a refund for a payment with a merchant you have previous transactions with, according to Mastercard’s rules, you’re not eligible for a chargeback due to the fact that you’ve accepted the Terms & Conditions of the merchant, therefore you must settle your dispute directly with the merchant.\n\n## The payment was authorized via 3DS  or made via Apple/Google Pay \n\nWhen the transaction reported as unrecognized was authorized via 3D secure code or the payment was processed via Apple/Google Pay this means that you’ve personally accepted the payment. Therefore you’re not eligible for a chargeback as per Mastercard’s regulations.\n\n## The payment was performed with a Maestro card\n\nWe are not able to process chargeback cases for Maestro card payments. The Consumer Protection from Mastercard is only applicable for payments performed with a Mastercard.\n\n## We didn’t receive an answer from you for more than 5 days ❓\n\nFor some requests, we need additional info in order to see the full picture. Thus we simply contact you through the app and request this info from you. \n\nIn case that you fail to provide the requested information within 5 days, we’ll automatically deny the chargeback request and close the case.\n\n\n__________\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [When can I request a refund and what do I need to do?](https://together.bunq.com/d/49933)\n- [How are my refunds processed?](https://together.bunq.com/d/48165)\n- [Everything about refunds](https://together.bunq.com/d/27036)\n- [How to request an in-app refund?](https://together.bunq.com/d/47826)\n\nExplore more bunq knowledge [here](https://go.bunq.com/link/knowledge) \n",

Although we’re quick,  other banks can take up to 30 days to synchronize the new trade names. If they send you a message saying they can’t verify your trade name(s) yet, this is the reason. Once your trade name is synchronized from their side you’re good to go.\n\n___\n\n## Good to know\n\n- The feature is only available for Dutch Business users with an Easy Money or Easy Green plan\n- Every trade name linked to a Bank Account comes with a monthly fee of €2.99\n- The trade name needs to be registered at the KvK\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [Who can open a bunq Business account?](https://together.bunq.com/d/1014)\n- [Why do you need a Personal account with your Business account?](https://together.bunq.com/d/38241)\n- [What documents do I need to provide to open a Business account? ](https://together.bunq.com/d/24017)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "What’s EVR, and how does bunq use it?\n\nHey bunqers \n\nWe always aim to keep the banking environment secure and free from fraudsters. In order to achieve that, we work with multiple governments and organizations, which ensure your banking security.\n\nOne of the steps we take to keep you and your money secure involves adding fraudsters to the EVR register.\n\n### What’s the EVR register?\n\nEVR is the Dutch banking External Referral Register. In this register, all banks part of the [PIFI](https://www.nvb.nl/publicaties/protocollen-regelingen-richtlijnen/protocol-incidenten-waarschuwingssysteem-financi%C3%ABle-instellingen/) are allowed to report and identify fraudulent persons.

Click [here](https://www.nvb.nl/themas/veilig-bankieren/waarschuwingsregisters-van-banken/) \n\n## How do you get added to the EVR? \n\nYou may be added to the EVR if you partake in an incident of fraud and/or by not following our [Terms & Conditions](https://www.bunq.com/documents).\n\n## I received a notification from bunq that I was added to the EVR, what’s next?\n\nThis means that you were added to the External Referral Register and, as a consequence, you might have limited access to other banking or financial services in The Netherlands.\n\n## What data is added? \n\nThe EVR only contains a person's name and date of birth, or a company’s owner and KvK number. This means that the register will not state publicly the reason why someone is registered. That information is only known to the security department of the financial institution that registered you. \n\n## There’s a mistake, I don’t recognize this fraud case!

    "source_text" : "Anti-Fraud Guide: Belastingdienst phishing scams on the rise. How to avoid them?\n\n\nHey bunqers \n\nWe’ve received warnings from the Belastingdienst and the Police of fraudulent attempts to impersonate the tax authorities and other government online services such as MijnOverheid or MijnDigid. For that reason, we’d like to share a couple of pro-tips on how to avoid being scammed by such phishing attacks.\n\nMake sure that you do not click on the link you receive via SMS. You can always verify on the official Belastingdienst, MijnOverheid or MijnDigid websites if you have any payments to settle with them.\n\n**Important things to keep in mind:**\n\n- **The Belastingdienst never sends direct payment requests.** Debtors are contacted with payment information. You may be contacted in written form, but the Tax Authorities will never contact you via chat or email.\n- Neither bunq, nor the authorities would ever ask for your personal information or login credentials via SMS, phone, or third party messenger.\n\n## How to avoid phishing scams?\n\n1. Don’t follow suspicious links sent to you via different channels without first checking whether they are legitimate.\n\n2. If you want to check whether you have outstanding debt to the tax authorities or any other information in the government online services, you can visit their official online platforms:\n - Mijn Belastingdienst\n - Mijn Belastingdienst Zakelijk\n - Mijn Toeslagen\n - MijnOverheid\n - Mijn DigiD\n\nMore information can be found on the [Belastingdienst’s official website](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/nl/contact/content/valse-whatsapp-berichten-sms-berichten-mails-apps-brieven-of-telefoontjes).\n\n## What should I do if I receive a phishing message like the one described here?\n\nIf you stumble upon an Authorities scam, please:\n\n- Don’t engage with the fraudsters message and avoid following any links or instructions\n- Report the case to us via our [report form](https://www.bunq.com/report/phishing), so that we can take further actions immediately\n- You can also report the case to the Belastingdienst [here](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/standaard_functies/prive/contact/fraude_misdaad_en_misstanden_melden/valse_mail_brieven_telf_app/)\n\n## What will happen next?\n\nOur team works closely with other institutions and together take the needed action to have such websites down and keep everyone safe. \n\n## Do you need to report a phishing case?\n\nIf it's a fraudulent user, you can help keep bunq safe. Simply send an email to report@bunq.com and we’ll take it from there. If reporting a possible fraudster that uses bunq for illegal purposes, please fill out [this form](https://www.bunq.com/report/fraud) to report the incident and help us to fight fraud!\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- [How to recognize fraud and stay safe?](https://together.bunq.com/d/40318) \n- [What’s phishing and how to recognize it?](https://together.bunq.com/d/54498) \n- [Spoofing - The dynamic ways of scamming nowadays, explained](https://together.bunq.com/d/45398) \n- [I was scammed.

In case of permanent account closure, all incoming payments made during the review period will be returned to their sender.\n\n## Why has my account been restricted?\n\nWe continuously monitor users’ activity and ensure their financial security and compliance with bunq’s Terms and Conditions.

Tap on  Home\n2. Tap on your UK sub-account\n3. Find your Sort Code under \"IBAN & BIC\"\n\n## Do I need a Sort Code to make a payment?\n\nNow that we know what exactly is a Sort Code, let’s talk about bunq and if you need a Sort Code in order to [make a payment](https://together.bunq.com/d/115-how-to-make-a-payment/4). \n\nbunq is part of the EURO-SEPA region and for this reason you don’t need a Sort Code in order to make payments as long as you have an IBAN everything will be fine. \n\nYour bunq IBAN can be found in the app, you check more about this [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/2880), Travel users please follow this link [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/22399).\n\nYou don’t have to worry if your IBAN is not a UK one, our Dutch IBANs are accepted worldwide and you can use bunq IBAN to receive your salary for example. Your bunq IBAN should be accepted by merchants or employers since European countries have agreed on this simplified IBAN system to facilitate international transfers within Europe.  You can find more details [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/23003-experiencing-iban-discrimination-here-s-what-you-should-do).\n\nThe important thing is to make your payment in EURO, because we are operating in the European Economic Area and the official currency is EURO. \n\nDon’t worry if you don’t know how to convert your payments, our amazing partner TransferWise is here to help you!\nWith TransferWise you can send payments in [more than 30 currencies](https://together.bunq.com/d/5185-transferwise-currencies/2), the payment will be converted automatically in EURO.

    "source_text" : "How does Localized Card Protection work? \n\nHey bunqers \n\nNever worry about your card’s safety, thanks to a card that will only work where you are, based on your phone's location. If “Localized Card Protection” is on, card payments are enabled at merchants whose location is within 100km of you. This means that the physical authorization of your card payments will happen automatically based on your device’s location. \n\n### How do I enable “Localized Card Protection”? \n\nFollow these easy steps to set it up:  \n\n1. Go to **Home** \n2. Select any of your bunq cards\n3. Tap on **Settings** in the right corner of your screen\n4. Click on **Allowed Countries**\n5. Turn on the “Localized Card Protection” toggle \n6. Done! Your cards now only work where you are, based on your phone’s location\n\nPlease note that this feature will use your device’s location. If you haven’t given the bunq app permission to “Always Allow” location access in your phone’s settings, or if you’re offline (with a turned off internet connection), this feature won’t work, since we won’t know your phone’s location. \n\n## How do I set up my Allowed Countries manually?\n\n1. Go to **Home** \n2. Tap on **Cards** \n3. Select the card you'll use\n4. Tap on **Settings** in the right corner of your screen\n5. Click on **Allowed Countries**\n6. Select Add Country and choose the country you want to use your card in\n\n______________\n\n##  My card doesn’t work with “Localized Card Protection” enabled. What should I do? \n\nIn order for the setting to work, the app needs to use your device’s current location. For that you need an active internet connection, so that the information flow is successful. However if your location is missing, or the app can’t read it - your payment might fail. But worry not - here’s what you can do in such cases: \n\n- **If you haven’t allowed the app to use your current location** - simply go to your phone’s app permission settings and turn on the “Always Allow” location setting. This way the bunq app can use your location consistently and therefore authorize your card payments wherever you are. Once enabled - it’ll work just fine ✨\n\n  - Keep in mind that your device may offer different location access options, however enabling the “Always Allow” setting will provide you with the best experience! If the app has partial access to your device’s location, the app will remember the last country where your device was active. \n\n- **If you’re offline** - you’ll receive an SMS notification immediately, explaining why the payment failed. In such a case simply turn on the mobile data of your device / connect to an internet hotspot. Once you do, the bunq app will immediately get the info that it needs and you can redo the payment successfully. \n\n- **The merchant has been registered in a different location**  - Some merchants have a couple of locations and they can be registered in a different geolocation than the one you’re on. In this case, it will be better to disable the “Localized Card Protection” toggle for the time being, then try the payment again\n\n\n## Good to know\n\n- Some merchants don't provide accurate location data to us. If we don't know a merchant's geolocation, we'll use their registered country instead. Payments will be accepted if the merchant is registered in the same country as you are.\n\n- The 100km applies in any direction.\n\n## Related Topics\n\n\n- [How do I solve a failed card payment?](https://together.bunq.com/d/24142-how-do-i-solve-a-failed-card-payment)\n- [How do I activate and deactivate my card?](https://together.bunq.com/d/3985)\n- [What are my daily card, cash deposits and withdrawals limits?](https://together.bunq.com/d/6635)\n- [How does bunq keep my card secure?](https://together.bunq.com/d/2815)\n\nExplore more bunq knowledge [here](https://go.bunq.com/link/knowledge) ",

Go to Home\n2. Tap on the Joint Account\n3. Select Settings\n4. Tap on Close account\n\n**Note:** A Joint Account is legally owned by all users it has been initially shared with. This means that no new users can gain access to it at a later point in time due to legal regulations. When the Joint Account is closed - it's deactivated for all parties involved and can't be reactivated.\n\n## Good to know\n\n- The Joint Account counts towards the maximum of 25 Bank Accounts. \n- You can't re-open a Joint Account once it's closed from you in the app. \n- Maestro cards have the IBAN of the Joint Account printed on them. Yet, cards are **bounded to card owners** so it will only show the name of the cardholder.\n- All of the funds are shared, meaning that if you have [negative balance](https://together.bunq.com/d/24781-why-do-i-have-a-negative-balance) this is shared amongst the legal owners as well. \n- You can also request a switch service for a Joint Account as explained [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/4706)\n- When you send out payments from your Joint Account, the receiving party will see a \"CJ\" at the end of the sender's name.

However, you can share access from a personal account through [Shared Access](https://together.bunq.com/d/1982).\n- If one of the owners wants to close the account, the entire account will need to be closed and there is no way of keeping the account as closing the account is equally shared as well. \n- When you go to your Joint Account, you can see who paid what by checking the little circle with your or your partner’s profile pic.

    "source_text" : "How can I open an in-app Payment Investigation?\n\nHey bunqers \n\nSomeone sent you a payment and you're still waiting for it, even though the expected time period has passed? You can open a Payment Investigation all by yourself through the app. However, before kicking off the process, see if your payment needs investigating or if it’s still within the expected timeframe \n- bunq: always instant!\n- SEPA: usually instant, but can take 1-2 business days.\n- SWIFT: usually 2-3 business days, but can take up to 1 week.\n\n**Note: All payments are subject to continuous monitoring so that bunq can ensure the security of your account. This may affect the timeframes listed above.**\n\n### How do I start a Payment Investigation for an Incoming Payment?\n\nTo start a Payment Investigation, you can follow this easy process: \n\n1. Go to Profile\n2. Select  Support\n3. Click on I have a problem with a payment \n4. Select I have a missing payment \n5.. Follow the rest of the flow \n\n### Can I start a Payment Investigation for an Outgoing Payment?\n\nIn bunq we aim to process outgoing payments promptly. However, please be aware that there might be a monitoring delay. To provide proof of a successful payment, you can [export a statement](deeplink) from your account and share it with the recipient.\n\n## What info is needed for a payment investigation? \n\nDepending on the payment, different information is required to help us locate your funds: \n\n- **SEPA (SCT) / Instant payment** \n\na) Sending IBAN \nb) Receiving IBAN \nc) Date of the transfer \nd) Currency and amount \ne) Payment confirmation and EBA transaction ID or EBA message ID \n\n- **SWIFT payment**\n\na) Sending IBAN \nb) Receiving IBAN \nc) Date of the transfer \nd) Currency and amount \ne) Payment confirmation and SWIFT reference (or MT103 export) - You're always welcome to request a SWIFT settlement confirmation from the sending bank to us\n\n- **Missing card refund**\n\na) Original card payment\nb) Acquirer reference number (ARN ID) of the refund (23 numbers)\nc) Date the refund was sent \n\n- **Missing iDEAL payment**\n\na) Sending IBAN \nb) Receiving IBAN \nc) Amount and date\nd) Payment confirmation\n\n- **Wise and \n\na) Sending IBAN \nb) Receiving IBAN \nc) Amount and date\nd) Confirmation (can be a screenshot in the app that shows the amount in EUR and the amount in the other currency)\nd) Wise transaction ID \n\n- **Currencycloud**\n\na) Sending IBAN \nb) Receiving IBAN \nc) Amount and date\nd) Confirmation (can be a screenshot that shows the amount)\nd) Payment reference\n\n## What’s an EBA ID?\nEBA ID or \"European Banking Association ID\" is a unique transfer ID. Every transfer you make has this ID, so that it can be recognized by every European bank. \n\nIf you’ve sent a SEPA transfer and it hasn't arrived within 2 business days, you can request this ID from the sending bank and provide it to the receiving bank. This way they can trace the payment. \n\n## What’s an ARN ID?\nARN ID or “Acquirer Reference Number“ is another payment ID and is a unique number assigned to a card transaction as it moves through the payment flow. The ARN can be used to track a payment or a refund you’ve made.\n\nIn case you’re asked for  an ARN ID, you can request it from the sending bank and provide it wherever is needed. \n\n## What happens after I’ve submitted the Payment Investigation?\n\nOur relevant department will review your missing payment in 5 business days and contact you through the open event in your Bank Account’s overview. You’ll receive a pop-up notification once we’ve got news for you. You can always check the investigation yourself by going to your Home page > click on the Bank Account in question > tap on the investigation event > check the feedback you’ve received. \n\n## Good to know\n\n- Selfies, ID cards, random pictures or statements that don't relate to the missing payment won't be accepted. This can directly lead to the investigation being closed due to lack of information or data mismatch. \n- The payment confirmation should be for the missing payment only\n- Open one payment investigation per missing payment, so that the investigation can proceed normally \n\n## Related topics \n\n- [SWIFT payments - what is this and how does it work?](https://together.bunq.com/d/48261)\n- [Does bunq support instant payments?](https://together.bunq.com/d/40305)\n\nWant to learn more?

You can set it up in just 5 minutes.

We’ve designed this exciting plan to bring you the most essential and iconic bunq features, with the easiest setup.\n\nFrom now on, you won’t be able to open an Easy Travel plan or switch to that plan. If you have a current ongoing Easy Travel plan, you can stick with it until your **Active** Travel Card expires. If you are an Easy Travel user **without a card** you can also stay with your Easy Travel plan, but when you want to order a new bunq card, you’ll need to choose a new plan. Keep in mind that if you decide to change your plan, you won’t be able to go back to Easy Travel.\n\n- **What happened with +1**\n\nWith the introduction of our newest plan that fits your needs, Easy Bank, we’ve also discontinued +1.\n\nAll +1 users will be automatically switched to our new plan - Easy Bank (learn more about this plan [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/44002). \n\nIf you were a +1 and you had a shared account already, fear not, the shared account will remain active after the update too. The cost remains the same, but the billing will now be from your own, personal account. \n\nFor +1 employees, the price remains the same. The only difference is that now billing will be made from your account, but the Bank Account remains shared so you still have access to it as before.\n\n- **I’m a Business Director and I need a free personal account**\n\nFrom now on the director who opens an Easy Money or Easy Green business account will have a free personal account if they don’t use any of our personal features. More than 3 directors? Every additional personal account for other directors, the business account will be invoiced 2.99 EUR per director. However, if you change your mind, you can always upgrade to a paid plan and enjoy all the cool features coming with it.\n\n- **Child account changes**\n\nCreating an account for your child just got easier. \n\nFrom now you can invite your child by following this simple process: \n\n1. Open the bunq app\n2. Head to the Community tab\n3. Select “Invite a Friend - Get 10 trees by introducing your friend to bunq”\n4. Click Invite Friends\n5. Share your link!\n\nYou can learn more about this change [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/2961)\n\nWhen signing up and providing personal info, your child will be asked to mention their parent. You'll need to confirm you're allowing them to have the account. Once reviewed and approved by the bunq team, your child can enjoy their personal account.\n\n\n- **Price Changes - what does that mean for me?**\n\nWe're constantly working towards making life easy. That's why we’ve invested in new benefits and features that bring value to your everyday life. We've made some changes to Pricing that we'd like to share with you. \n\nCurrent bunqers get 2 months notice, meaning that the new prices will apply to you after 2 months. The fee for all current plans will increase with €1.00 each per month. More info can be found [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/43999)\n\nFor bunqers-to-be, the new pricing applies right away. \n\n## New Features\n\n- **SOS Support**\n\nSOS?

    "source_text" : "How to sort payments automatically with Payment Sorter \n\nHey bunqers  \n\nEnjoy effortless budgeting while automatically splitting your payments between Bank Accounts! This feature helps with budgeting directly from the source! Once you get paid, you choose how much you’d like to transfer between Bank Accounts.\n\n\n### What is a Payment Sorter? \n\nAutomagically let incoming payments flow to Bank Accounts, your savings goals or any IBAN from any bank. Be it your landlady, a charity close to your heart or the ski trip you're saving up for, you're sorted month after month! \n\n\n## How does the Payment sorter work in the bunq app? \nThis feature can be used for any recurring incoming payment, like a salary or a payment made regularly from a friend, relative or organization. \nWhen you receive this payment, you only need to set it up once, and that’s it. You can also enable it at another time by following the steps below: \n\n1. Go to **Home** tab\n2. Select your **Bank Account**\n3. Select the transaction to be sorted\n4. Select **Sort**\n5. Select **Next** \n6. Select the **amount** you want to be forwarded to the different account and confirm. **While choosing the amounts you can choose to sort by % or amount.**\n\nYou can check all your sorted payments by going to the desired Bank Account and tapping on **Settings** in the right corner of your screen. Select **Auto Sorted Payments**.\n\nKeep in mind that you can't re-sort a recurring payment which was already sorted this month. You'll have to wait for the next recurring payment in order to sort it again.\n\n## Can Business users sort their payments while AutoVAT is enabled? \nYes! These can both be enabled at the same time. If both are set up, AutoVAT will be deducted first and the rest of the amount will be sorted according to your preferences.\n\n\n## Who can sort payments automatically? \n\nYou'll be able to easily split your salary or any recurring incoming transfer with an Easy Money or Easy Green plan.\n\n**Important note:** The feature can't be used with any of the [Local Currencies](https://together.bunq.com/d/45414) we currently provide.\n\n\n## What if the amount differs from one month to another? \nThat’s not a problem! As long as the amount is high enough to make the sorting possible, the payment sorter will do its job and transfer the amounts you chose to all the Bank Accounts concerned.\n\n\nRead more about the Payment Sorter on our [blog](https://www.bunq.com/blog/quick-and-easy-budgeting-tips-to-keep-your-hands-off-your-savings) \n\n## Related topics \n\n- [Payment Sorter by %](https://together.bunq.com/d/41422)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "How do I solve a failed card payment?\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nThere are a few things you should pay attention to if you're trying to pay with your bunq card and the payment isn't accepted. Below you’ll find a list of what you should check if your card payment fails. \n\nClick on the type of payment that failed to see what could have gone wrong and how to resolve it \n____ \n\n## Card payment requiring a PIN code\n\n- See how to resolve failed PIN payments [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/50011)\n\n____\n\n## Contactless payment \n\n- See how to resolve failed Contactless payment [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/50013)\n\n____\n\n## Online payment \n\n- See how to resolve failed Online payments [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/50016)\n\n____ \n\n## If the payment failed and there's no event in your bunq app\nIf you tried to pay with your bunq card, the payment wasn't accepted and nothing appeared under “Events” in your bunq app, this may be due to one of the following reasons: \n\n* You're using a card that isn't accepted by the terminal. You should therefore try to use your Mastercard Credit if you tried to pay with the Maestro or Mastercard Debit (and vice-versa).\n* You're paying at an offline terminal with a Maestro or Mastercard Debit card. In this case, you should use your Mastercard Credit to solve it. \n* Your card is being blocked by the acquirer. In this situation, you can contact the merchant to help them ensure that your card is accepted correctly. \n* Your card is faulty and your payments get declined everywhere. The only thing to do in this situation is to [replace your card](https://together.bunq.com/d/1974) in the bunq app. You can always use Apple Pay or Google Pay, until your new card gets delivered for your purchases. \n* When you pay on a POS terminal, errors with different messages can appear on it if the payment fails. Some of them will state the exact reason why this card payment has failed and others will show a different type of error. This might be caused by the card not being accepted by the terminal so we suggest trying another card of yours or try paying with your Google or Apple Pay.\n\n  **Important**: We don't support direct transactions to bunq cards yet. This means that all transactions sent to the card won't be accepted. We recommend you to contact the sender and ask them to transfer the amount to [your IBAN](https://together.bunq.com/d/2880-how-do-i-find-my-iban/5) instead. You'll be able to receive the money that way, without any issue!\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [How do I order a card?](https://together.bunq.com/d/2936)\n- [How do I solve a failed online payment?](https://together.bunq.com/d/50016)\n- [What does the status of my card payment mean?](https://together.bunq.com/d/16793)\n\nWant to learn more?

One of our missions is to help you get the financial stability that you need to live life on your terms!\n\nFirst step in taking control of your finances is understanding where the money is going 類 We can help with that! \n\n## Merchant overview\n\nAre you often going to the same store, same café, same gym? Want to know how much money you spend there? In the Home tab, choose your account, and select the merchant icon in the payment details screen to see a clear overview of all the payments made to them. It’s that simple ⚡️\n\nThis way you can see how every purchase affects your budget and adapt your spending habits to meet your savings goals.\n\n## Spending categories limits\n\nYou can now set sending limits by Budgeting category ✨ \n\nIf your spending reaches 80%, 95%, or 100% of a set limit, the app will alert you.

The above limits are the maximum technically possible. It is not possible to set a higher daily limit.\n\n## Contactless payments\n\nThere's a **€50 limit per contactless payment** in:\n\nAndorra, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, France, French Guiana, Greece, Germany, Guadeloupe, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Malta, Martinique, Monaco, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, St Pierre and Miquelon.\n\n❗️ Contactless limits in a currency other than EUR are listed [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/27058-what-are-the-limits-for-contactless-payments).\n\nYour **PIN** will be requested **after 5 contactless payments** or when you've made contactless payments for more than 150 EUR (cumulative). So if the 4th contactless payment makes the sum of the 4 payments higher than 150 EUR, the PIN will be requested.\n\n---\n## Good to know\n\n- The language of the terminals depends on the language of the card. Your card language is set automatically as the phone language at the point of ordering the card. The only way to change the terminal language is to order a new/replacement card with the preferred language set.\n- You have one card limit in place that applies to all transactions and in addition, you can choose to have the limit apply to all cards, or set a limit for each individual card. Keep in mind, this limit is a cumulative limit and is applied per card. This means, if your limit is €1000 and it applies to all cards, you can spend €1000 on each card.\n- The contactless limit in the Netherlands is €25 (keep in mind this limit may vary per country). As such, anything above €25 will require a PIN☝️.\n- You can however spend up to €50 contactless cumulatively. So, when you reach the €50 limit, you'll need to provide a PIN and the counter will reset again.\n\n--- \n\n## Related topics\n\n- [What are my daily Local Currencies limits?](https://together.bunq.com/d/46763)\n- [How can I change my daily card limit?](https://together.bunq.com/d/4757)\n- [How do I change my daily bank account limit?](https://together.bunq.com/d/24281)\n- [Withdraw & Deposit cash with Barzahlen/viacash](https://together.bunq.com/d/14531)\n- [How do I add my bunq card to Apple Pay?](https://together.bunq.com/d/5826)\n- [What is Google Pay and how do I enable it?](https://together.bunq.com/d/8480)\n\nExplore more bunq knowledge [here](https://go.bunq.com/link/knowledge) ",

    "source_text" : "I have a failed payment due to 3DS2, now what?\n\nHey bunqers \n\nWe want to let you know about an important update that we’ve just rolled out!\n\nIt’s called **3DS2,** and it’s the new security standard for e-commerce transactions. We’ve added this feature in order to ensure the highest standards of fraud prevention for you. Online card payments are now more secure than ever!  \n\n### I have a failed payment, now what?\n\nFirstly, make sure that your payment was indeed denied due to 3DS2. To do so, go to your payment Event and check the reason for failure. It is right below the payment amount \n\nIf you see _Your payment was declined due to 3DS Secure Authentication failure_ then this is indeed a case of soft decline.\n\nTo adjust this in a few easy taps, simply **enable [Auto Accept](https://together.bunq.com/d/45244)** and try again! The payment should be paid correctly this time.\n\n---\n\nAs of the 1st January 2021, new regulations have come into effect that aim to increase the safety and security of card payments all across Europe. These new regulations are part of Europe’s PSD2, which seeks to improve the security of payments, boost innovation and help banks across Europe with modernising and adapting to new services. As part of the process to continue to modernise and ensure the highest safety standards, 3DS2 was introduced. \n\n---\n\n## What is 3DS2?\n\n**3DS2** is a type of security feature known as Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) or two-step verification. This type of verification ensures that you, the card holder, are the one performing the payment and no one else 亮 \n\nAll that’s required from you is to \"_Accept_\" or \"_Deny_\" the transaction via push notification. That’s it!  \n\nWe brought this security standard to our users in December 2020 and made sure that with bunq, it would be a quick and easy feature. With this new high-end security feature, users can authorise online card payments through a push notification from the bunq app. Once you’ve approved the purchase, you’re done! We’ve made it easier and faster than ever to approve your purchases \n\n## How do these rules impact me? \n\nLuckily, most of our users won’t notice the changes and can continue to do payments as usual.  In some rare cases, you might come across a failed card payment because the merchant doesn’t process the payment using the most recent and highest security standards. We believe in transparency, which is why we have implemented a text to notify you about online payments that failed because they didn’t meet that high security standard. \n\nAs it’s required for us to decline these unsafe payments, you might encounter a failed payment for certain online transactions. We’re always looking for ways to improve your banking experience, but of course the safety of your money comes first   \n\nIf you encounter any problems, please [reach out to our Support team](https://go.bunq.com/link/support).  \n\n## Related topics\n\n- [What does the status of my card payment mean?](https://together.bunq.com/d/16793)\n- [How do I solve a failed card payment?](https://together.bunq.com/d/24142)\n\nTake a look at the knowledge section of Together [here.](https://together.bunq.com/t/knowledge)\n",

    "source_text" : "Update to Support: Supertickets \n\nHey bunqers \n\nWith bunq Update 20, we introduced Supertickets. Get immediate support, tailored to your questions, and help improve support for other users by rating our guides and sharing your feedback.\n\n### How does it work?\n\n- When you contact support, you’ll have a brand new flow which will help you find the answer to your question in just a few taps. If you don’t find what you’re looking for, you can contact our Support guides, who’ll assist you further \n\n- One of the improvements we implemented is the feedback form for your experience with Support. When you finish a conversation with a Support guide, you can now rate them, based on their assistance’s quality, clearance and accuracy;\n\n- For every feedback form you send, you’ll earn extra points to your Community profile - this will grant you a higher level, thus faster support when you need it 彩\n\n- From now on, the guides who assist you will also rate their experience with you. These ratings can benefit your Community level and bring you faster support. See more about the new Community levels [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/48505);\n\n**Important note:** We know that including Community involvement to the prioritisation of your support tickets can seem worrisome. Let us tell you where we come from \n\nWe've watched the bunq community grow and help one another, as well as bunq by giving us your unfiltered feedback and ideas. A lot of our Community members have taken the time to answer someone else’s question, start a conversation or find an issue’s resolution for themselves. So far, this has been done without reward or acknowledgement. bunq Update 20 set out to change that;\n\nMoving forward we want to show you even more that we value your involvement with bunq, be it as a ticket rating, Together discussion or simple hi-five. We want to give back to those that give us their time and attention;\n\nKeep in mind that the Community rank system is made to benefit your experience. This means that even if you're not active in our Community and have less points than others, your Support experience will be regular (as before). The prioritisation of SOS tickets remains the highest by default and we have no plans changing that either \n\n---\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [How do I contact Support?](https://together.bunq.com/d/32181)\n- [What are the Community levels and how do I earn points?](https://together.bunq.com/d/48505)\n- [Together Community Guidelines](https://together.bunq.com/d/6226)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "How is my MassInterest calculated and paid out?\n\nHey bunqers \n\nAs you know, with [bunq MassInterest](https://together.bunq.com/d/8298) you receive an interest rate higher than traditional banks:\n\n#### Personal Accounts\n\n- For  Dutch,  Irish and  Spanish residents: 2.46%\n- For  New German users, who signed up before October 19: 2.55% for the first 4 months, afterwards: 1.56%\n- For  New German users, who signed up on/after October 19: 3.85% for the first 4 months, afterwards: 1.56%\n- For  Rest of the EEA residents: 1.56%\n- For  USD and  GBP Savings Accounts: 3.71%\n\n#### Business Accounts\n\n- For  All EEA residents: 1.05%\n- For  USD and  GBP Savings Accounts: 2.3%\n\nWondering how it’s calculated and how you can foresee your annual MassInterest Rate? Learn more below.\n\n## How do we calculate MassInterest? \n\nWe take the interest rate, divide it by the number of days in the year, to get a daily interest rate (a leap year has 366 days). Then your interest is calculated **every day at 23:59 CET** and this is what happens: \n\n- We start by taking all the Savings Accounts you have per currency;\n- We take the balances of all accounts;\n- We get all the payments made and received during the day;\n- Based on the payments, we calculate what **your lowest total balance of your Savings Accounts** was during the day;\n- If you have a Joint Savings Account (fully, legally shared between multiple people), we divide the balance of the account equally by the number of owners;\n- In a leap year, you'll get a lower interest rate because it has 366 days. Keep in mind that the examples provided below are based on a regular year of 365 days.\n\nAfterwards, you’ll receive your weekly interest (calculated based on the daily interest rates you’ve had during the past week) on your weekly Payday. Further information on how to find it can be seen [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/57060).  \n\n* In case of a disabled Payday toggle, you won’t receive MassInterest.\n\n* In case of a negative balance in any of your sub-accounts, we sum up the total balance of your account. If the total balance of your account is negative, the interest balance is zero for each day until resolved. \n\n* If you don’t have enough balance in your Savings Account to generate €0.01, MassInterest won’t be received. \n\n## How do I calculate MassInterest for a Personal Account? \n\nThe 1.56% (**2.46%** for Dutch, Irish and Spanish residents), 3.71% ( for Multi-Currency Personal Savings Accounts), 2.3% ( for Multi-Currency Business Savings Accounts), and 1.05% (for Business accounts) interest rates are  annual ones.\n\n#### If you're a  Dutch,  Irish and  Spanish residents\n\nYou get 2.46% MassInterest. If you have €100,000 in your bunq Savings Account every day, you’ll get €2,460 per year. The interest you earn will be calculated and accrued daily but paid out weekly. This makes €2,460 / 365 = €6.74 per day. Thus, you’ll earn €6.74 x 7 days = €47.18 per week.\n\n\n####  If you're from any other European country\n\nYou get 1.56% MassInterest.If you have €100,000 in your bunq Savings Account every day, you’ll get €1,560 per year. The interest you earn will be calculated and accrued daily but paid out weekly. This makes €1,560 / 365 = €4.27 per day. Thus, you’ll earn €4.27 x 7 days = €29.89 per week.\n\n\n####  If you’re a new bunq user and German resident\n \nNew German users who signed up on/after October 19, 2023 get 3.85% MassInterest. If you have €100,000 in your bunq Savings Account every day **for the first 4 months**, then you’ll get €320.83 per month [total of €1,283.32 for the whole 4-month period]. The interest you earn will be calculated and accrued daily but paid out weekly. This makes €1,283.32 / 119 days (17 weeks) = €10.78 per day. Thus, you’ll earn €10.78 x 7 days = 75.46 per week. \n\n**However, if you’ve registered before October 19, 2023, the interest rate applied on your account for the first 4 months will be 2.55% and your calculation will look like this:**\n\nIf you have €100,000 in your bunq Savings Account every day **for the first 4 months**, then you’ll get €212.5 per month [total of €850 for the whole 4-month period]. The interest you earn will be calculated and accrued daily but paid out weekly. This makes €850 / 119 days (17 weeks) = €7.14 per day. Thus, you’ll earn €7.14 x 7 days = €49.98 per week. \n\nOnce the 4-month promotion period has ended, your MassInterest rate will be 1.56% - you can see how the calculation would change in the section above. \n\n#### If you’re saving in  USD and  GBP from a Personal accounts\n\nUsers who save in  USD and  GBP in their Personal accounts get 3.71% MassInterest. If you have $/￡100,000 in your bunq Savings Account every day, you’ll get $/￡3,710 per year. The interest you earn will be calculated and accrued daily but paid out weekly. This makes $/￡3,710 / 365 = €10.16 per day. Thus, you’ll earn €10.16 x 7 days = €71.12 per week.\n\n## How do I calculate MassInterest for a Business Account? \n\nThe 1.05% interest rate is an annual interest rate for your Business Savings Account. \n\n* The 1.05% interest rate is an annual interest rate for your Business Savings Account. When you have €100.000 on your bunq Savings Account every day, then you get €1050 per year.\n* The day in which you will be paid your interest can be seen in your [Payday](https://together.bunq.com/d/57060). \n\nThe interest you earn will be calculated and accrued daily but paid out weekly. This makes €1,050 / 365 = €2.87 per day. Thus, you’ll earn €2.87 x 7 days = €20.09 per week.\n\n#### If you’re saving in  USD and  GBP from a Business accounts\n\nUsers who save in  USD and  GBP in their Business accounts get 2.3% MassInterest.  If you have $/￡100,000 on your bunq Savings Account every day, then you get $/￡2,300 per year. The interest you earn will be calculated and accrued daily but paid out weekly. This makes €2,300 / 365 = €6.30 per day. Thus, you’ll earn €6.30 x 7 days = €44.1 per week.\n\n## How do I calculate MassInterest for Joint Savings Account [part of Personal Account]? \n\nEvery member is receiving the [interest rate which applies to them as per country and Savings Account currency](https://together.bunq.com/d/57041) for an equally divided part of the total amount from all funds in the Joint Savings Account.\n\nIf your Joint Savings Account receives a weekly interest rate of €100 and you co-own it with one more friend you'll each receive interest for €50 each (the interest earned on your Joint Savings Account divided by two).\n\nKeep in mind that for your individual Personal Account you can receive MassInterest up to €100,000. This limit covers your Personal Savings Account/s as well as your Joint Savings Account/s.\n\n## What’s the minimum amount I need to have in my Savings Account?\n\n####  If you're a  Dutch,  Irish and  Spanish residents\n\nTo receive MassInterest, the funds you have in your Savings Account must be able to generate an interest of €0.01 on a daily basis. If the annual interest rate is 2.46%, the daily interest rate will be 2.46% / 365 = 0.00673973%. You should have at least €149 to generate €149 x 0.00673973% = €0.01 interest rate daily. \n\n####  If you're from any other European country\n\nTo receive MassInterest, the funds you have in your Savings Account must be able to generate an interest of €0.01 on a daily basis. If the annual interest rate is 1.56%, the daily interest rate will be 1.56% / 365 = 0.00427397%. You should have at least €234 to generate €234 x 0.00427397% = €0.01 interest rate daily. \n\n####  If you’re a German resident\n\n**First 4 months**\n \nTo receive MassInterest, the funds you have in your Savings Account must be able to generate an interest of €0.01 on a daily basis. If the annual interest rate is 3.85% **for the first 4 months**, the daily interest rate will be 3.85% / 365 = 0.01054795%. You should have at least €95 to generate €95 x 0.01054795% = €0.01 interest rate daily. \n\nIf you’ve registered before **October 19, 2023**, the interest rate you’ll receive **for the first 4 months**. The daily interest rate will be 2.55% / 365 = 0.0069863%. Thus, you should have at least €144 to generate €144 x 0.0069863% = €0.01 interest rate daily.\n\n**After the promo period**\n\nOnce the 4-month promotion period has ended, your MassInterest rate will be 1.56% - you can see how the calculation would change in the section above. \n\n#### If you’re saving in  USD and  GBP from a Personal accounts\n\nTo receive MassInterest, the funds you have in your Savings Account must be able to generate an interest of €0.01 on a daily basis. If the annual interest rate is 3.71%, the daily interest rate will be 3.71% / 365 = 0.01016438%.

If the annual interest rate is 2.3%, the daily interest rate will be 2.3% / 365 = 0.00630137%. You should have at least €159 to generate €159 x 0.00630137% = €0.01 interest rate daily. \n\n####  If you're from any other European country and saving from a Business account\n\nTo receive MassInterest, the funds you have in your Savings Account must be able to generate an interest of €0.01 on a daily basis. If the annual interest rate is 1.05%, the daily interest rate will be 1.05% / 365 = 0.00287671%.

With just a tap in the app, you get instant access to spending category breakdowns and monthly comparisons, and you easily set up smart automations that help you save.\n\n## Spending Insights\n\nThe first thing you’ll see on the Budgeting tab is a graph that gives you instant and up-to-date information about your monthly spending. It provides a visual representation of your spending patterns and allows for easy comparisons with previous months, making it a powerful tool for managing your finances. You can view your spending per category and easily set spending limits. When you’ve spent 80%, 95% or 100% of a spending limit, the bunq app will send you a notification, making it easier to stay on budget without having to think about it. Additionally, you can create dedicated Bank Accounts for specific categories and budget from them automatically \n\nBelow the Budgeting graph you’ll find a pie chart where you see a breakdown of your monthly spend per category.

    "source_text" : "How to open a bunq account as an Ukrainian or Russian refugee?\n\nHey bunqers, \n\nWith the Russia-Ukraine war many people fled to places unknown to them. Our team on the ground noticed people need a way to make secure payments outside Ukraine, so we acted quickly to make it easier for refugees to get a bank account with all possible legal documentation. \n\nWe now see that most refugees managed to cover the need of a bank account, so as of September 23, 2022, we’re reverting back to our normal signup process for refugees. This ensures that we’ll be able to provide the best banking experience to everyone! However, keep in mind that some legal restrictions remain active, meaning that the total balance of all of your account is limited to €20,000.00.\n\n- **Important note:** As of August 5, 2022, we'll only accept personal accounts registrations for Ukrainian and Russian refugees from the following countries : Austria , Belgium , France , Germany , Ireland , Italy , The Netherlands , Portugal  and Spain  \n\n## What documents can I use to verify as a Ukrainian refugee?\n\n- Ukrainian ID card \n- Ukrainian passport \n\nMore info on the accepted documents for verification can be found [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/3355)\n\n- Keep in mind that you might be asked for proof of residence during your verification. You can learn more about this [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/20843-why-do-i-have-to-send-a-proof-of-residence/3)\n\n## What documents can I use to verify as a Russian refugee?\n\n- European Resident Permit Card\n\nMore info on the accepted documents for verification can be found [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/3355)\n\n- Keep in mind that you might be asked for proof of residence during your verification. You can learn more about this [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/20843-why-do-i-have-to-send-a-proof-of-residence/3)\n\n## Tips on opening a bunq account as an Ukrainian or Russian refugee\n\n1. Our current acceptance policy only allows for EEA residents to open a bunq account. To fit within our policy in case of a temporary address in the EEA, use the address where you'll reside in the following 5 days. If needed, update your app at a later date by following the steps [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/2546). \n\n2. The email or phone number used to open a bunq account is unique per user. Make sure to open an account with a different phone number and/or email every time. \n\n3. If you're having issues with verification, confirm whether you're using an unsupported ID document. We currently do **NOT** accept **Ukrainian or Russian drivers licenses** or **non-biometric Ukrainian or Russian passports**, as they don't fit in with EEA regulations on accepted documents for ID verification. \n\n## Want to learn more?\n\nIf you’re in need of help, willing and able to help others in the war affected region or want to donate, reach out to the [People for People](https://www.peopleforpeople.info) foundation, co-founded by bunq to connect people who can provide help to those who need it – Ukrainians and Russians alike.\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [Important changes in Wise's service towards Ukraine](https://together.bunq.com/d/57976)\n\nWant to learn more?

Go to one of your Bank Accounts\n2. Choose an incoming payment\n3. Tap on **Sort** in the middle\n5. Choose to sort in full amounts OR percentages.\n\n---\n\n## Future payments \nAllow a payment from the payer to be sorted if the sorting is possible. This means that the future payment sorting will be executed if the payment amount is higher than the money moving from the principal account to the other Bank Accounts.\n\n- Example:\nAmount to sort: €2.500,00\nSavings: €800,00\nFun stuff: €250,00\nGroceries : €150,00\nRemainder left in Main account: €1300,00\n\nAny payment in the future will be sorted **if** the payment **is more** than €1.200,00\n\n## Payments that can't be sorted\n1.

But no AutoVAT accounts.\n- If you receive a payment you want to sort but you only have 1 Bank Account, the app will prompt you to create more Bank Accounts.\n- Once the payment is sorted you'll see the complete, unsorted amount in the events overview. Beneath the complete amount in blue you'll see a smaller amount and sign showing that it was sorted.\n- Once the amount is sorted you can select the payment to see to which Bank Accounts the payments ended up in.\n- When you set up sorting for a recurring payment, but one of the designated Bank Accounts is closed, the money will move to the remainder account. Other payments will go through as intended.\n- You can edit the amounts that'll be moved in the future sorting. You just click on the payment event screen to adjust this. This can also be changed from the sort screen.\n- You can automatically sort up to 20 payments.\n\n_______ \n\n## Related Topics \n\n- [How can I make a payment?](https://together.bunq.com/d/115-how-to-make-a-payment/4)\n- [What are my daily payment limits?](https://together.bunq.com/d/49784)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "IBAN Discrimination - Report it now!\n\n\n\nHey bunqers \n\nOur job here at bunq is to empower you to be free and make life easy for you. This is why we provide you extra security, easy and fast processes and fast support. But much too often, we started receiving more and more cases of IBAN discrimination. \n\nThis happens especially when  businesses in the EU refuse to accept your IBAN because they need an IBAN from the country they're based in. This kind of discrimination is actually **illegal**. \n\nThat’s why we join Wise, Klarna, N26, SumUp and Revolut in a fight against “IBAN discrimination”. And you can help us!\n\n### How can I help? \n\nIf you’re experiencing  IBAN discrimination, you can report your case on this platform: **https://www.acceptmyiban.org/**\n\nOnce you report the case there, we’ll do the job for you by passing your report to the responsible authorities. No need to think about which form you should choose, and all kinds of hassle, we handle it for you! \n\n\n## Know your rights\n\nLike any other IBAN provided by a bank within the SEPA region (Single Euro Payment Area), your bunq IBAN should be accepted by merchants or employers, since European countries have agreed on this simplified IBAN system to facilitate international transfers within Europe.\n\nThis simply means that if merchants or employers don’t want to accept your bunq IBAN because of its country code, length or any other reason, they are violating European law as of 1 February 2016 (Article 9 of Regulation No 260/2012) and doing what we call IBAN discrimination.\n\n## Possible workaround - Local IBANs! \n\nIf the discriminating party has Dutch, German, French, Spanish or Irish origin, you can always provide them with a Local IBAN created by bunq and therefore have it accepted right away. Simply follow the easy steps explained [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/45253) to create a Local IBAN and resolve the issue right away.\n\nOf course, don't forget to report your case of discrimination as explained above \n\n## Related topics \n\n- [Local IBANs ](https://together.bunq.com/d/45253)\n- [What's the difference between Local IBAN and Local Currency?](https://together.bunq.com/d/48910)\n- [How do I verify in order to get my Local IBAN?](https://together.bunq.com/d/49026)\n\nWant to learn more?

Discover which categories are adding to your carbon emissions and see how your impact changes month by month. With the Green Tab, it’s easier than ever to start spending sustainably. \n\n### Where can I see my CO2 Footprint?\n\n1. Go to your  Green tab\n2. Scroll down to the “Your CO2 Footprint” graph\n3. You can also tap on “View Details” to see a detailed breakdown of your CO2 Footprint per category\n\n\nAdditionally, with every payment you make, you can see the exact CO2 contribution of that payment. To do so, you just need to tap on the payment event in the relevant Bank Account. \n\n## How is my CO2 Footprint calculated?\n\nWhenever you make a payment using your bunq account, you get insights on the carbon Footprint of your purchase. To calculate this carbon Footprint, we consider the country in which you made the payment, the payment category (e.g. Groceries, Travel, Fashion), the merchant, and how much you spent. To give you the most accurate insights, our method draws from an enormous amount of statistical data. Of course, each and every transaction is unique and the carbon Footprint you see in the app will not be 100% accurate. Instead it’s intended as a reliable estimate that helps you make informed decisions on how to live more sustainably.\n\n## Good to know\n\n- It’s important to note that the CO2 Footprint calculated is an estimate, not an exact measurement. We derive the estimate from an average within a category of goods/services and transaction value. However, the individual items in your shopping basket aren’t known to us. \n\n- Only payments made via card, iDeal, and direct debits will get a CO2 Footprint. \n\n- Your Footprint data is exclusively used to generate your carbon Footprint for your Insights and is not utilized for any other purposes.\n\n## Related topics \n\n\n- [Green Tab ](https://together.bunq.com/d/53931) \n- [Where can I see my card transaction overview ](https://together.bunq.com/d/43773)\n\n\nWant to learn more?

You can recognize this when you see the NL in your IBANs. If you’re a Spanish bunqer-to-be, all your IBANs since the opening of your new bunq account will have a Spanish IBAN - provided you’re a Spanish resident.\n\nThis is our latest IBAN milestone that we’re more than happy to share with you! It lets you bank like a local, from anywhere in Spain. ✨\n\n### How can I get a Spanish IBAN as a Spanish resident?\n\n1. Go to **Home** tab \n2. Tap on  **+ Add**\n3. Click on  Add a Sub-Account\n4. Select  Bank Account\n5. Personalize your sub-account\n6. Choose Local IBAN (Spanish)\n7. Done \n\n**If you’re a bunqer-to-be residing in Spain **\n\n1. Go through the verification process explained [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/24112-how-do-i-complete-my-identity-verification)\n2. Go with the verification flow ✅\n\nYou can check which identity documents we currently accept [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/3355) \n\nAnd the coolest part about this - the Spanish IBANs are available for all the plans we offer! (including Easy Bank, Easy Money, Easy Green and Pack)\n\n## But I have Dutch IBANs and now I want a Spanish one, what do I do? \n\nYou’ll be able to get your Spanish IBAN even if you had Dutch IBANs before that. Just keep in mind that **if you choose to go for a Spanish IBAN all your new sub-accounts will receive Spanish IBANs automatically**.  And your Dutch IBANs? You’re free to keep and use them as usual! \n\nAfter you confirm your choice to stick to Spanish IBANs, you’ll have to go through the verification process once again as shown right [here.](https://together.bunq.com/d/24112-how-do-i-complete-my-identity-verification)\n\nIf you have a Savings goal or a Joint account with a Dutch IBAN prior your transition to the Spanish branch, the IBAN will remain with its original Dutch branch number. In case you want to have Savings goal or a Joint account with Spanish IBAN, you should open a new account by following the regular process. \n\n## What if I'm not a Spanish resident but I still want a Spanish IBAN? \nNo need to worry - Local IBANs are here, and they’re the perfect fit for your international lifestyle.

    "source_text" : "How do I solve a failed online payment?\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nWe understand that encountering a failed online payment can be a bit frustrating. But don't worry, we're here to help! \n\nIn this topic, we'll guide you through the steps to troubleshoot and resolve common issues that might cause an online payment to fail. We'll also provide some insights into what different error messages might mean. \n\n## Wrong Card details \n\nIf you're trying to pay online with your bunq card and the payment is declined, the first thing to do would be checking again your card details and make sure you entered the correct card number, expiry date and you current CVC code, especially if you've the [rotating CVC feature](https://together.bunq.com/d/3019) on. \n\nYou can find your card details [here](https://go.bunq.com/link/cvc) or in the app under **Cards** >  **Select the right card** > **Card details** \n\n## Merchant is blocked \n\n If a payment to the same merchant failed more than 3 times within an hour, we'll block all transactions to this merchant for 60 minutes for security reasons. The failures can happen when you filled the card details incorrectly or if the merchant for some reason couldn’t process the information properly.\n \nIn this situation, you should wait an hour before you try to make another payment to this merchant. Be sure to turn off the [rotating CVC feature](https://together.bunq.com/d/3019) in your card settings, which allows the merchant to use the correct CVC.\n\n## Insufficient balance \n\nWhen you're trying to pay an amount bigger than the one on your account, the payment won't go through to make sure you don’t fall into debt. In this situation, you should [top up your account](https://together.bunq.com/d/2933) or [link your card to another bunq account](https://together.bunq.com/d/233) to complete the payment.\n\n## Card isn't active \n\nIn order to be approved, card payments must be done with an active card. This means that if you've just ordered you card and didn't activate it yet or if you card is temporarily frozen, the payment won't go through. In these cases, you should first [activate your card](https://together.bunq.com/d/3985) before you try to pay again. \n\n## No 3DS2/Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) \n\nTo increase the security of online card payments across the EEA region, new regulations were implemented on Jan 1st, 2021. This brought with it a new star - the 3DS2 security feature, otherwise known as Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). When you make an online payment, you can now easily authorize it through a push notification from the bunq app! However, in some cases, the merchant doesn't have things set up quite right on their end to meet these high security standards, and your payment might not go through. In this situation, it'd be best to use another payment method if possible.

After all, sharing is caring . But sometimes you will notice that comments or topics suddenly disappear. Let us explain why that happens. \n\n### Three reasons\n\nThere are basically three reasons why a post will get removed: \n\n1. To keep Together clear and neat!\nTo prevent Together from cluttering, we for instance will delete duplicate topics. Of course we first will give the user a proper answer or guide him/her to the appropriate topic. \n\n2. To keep a positive vibe!\nWe want Together to be a positive place. Of course you can also share your criticism as long as you do it in a respectful manner. So, for instance we won't tolerate any offensive language. Keep the bunq love spreading ❤️\n\n3. Post contains personal information\nSometimes a post accidently contains personal information. In order to protect the user in question we will remove the post or only specific information within the post. \n\n## Behind the scenes \nWhen something gets removed it will still be visible for the bunqer who wrote it and they also will see the reply of the moderator! \n\n## Locking a topic \nAnother option a moderator has, is locking a topic. This will happen when a discussion seems to spin out of control.

    "source_text" : "SWIFT payments - what is this and how does it work?\n\nHey bunqers \n\nAs you know, there are different types of bank transfers. One of them is called SWIFT and some of you use it pretty often. \n\nSWIFT payments are international transfers processed via the SWIFT international payment network - unlike regular SEPA payments. This network is one of the largest in the world. Most of these payments are from banks that aren’t within the SEPA (EEA) region. \n\n### How does SWIFT work? \n\nWhen you expect a SWIFT transfer, it may take up to 5 business days until you receive it. The longer waiting time for this type of payments is due to its specific way of processing - when your funds have to be transferred from a bank outside the EEA banking system, it takes longer for the information to be processed our way. You can learn more about the processing times [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/4295) \n\nKeep in mind that in order to receive SWIFT transfers, you need to fully verify your account. If you’re not verified, the payment will bounce back to the sending bank.\n\n## What if my SWIFT payment hasn't arrived?\n\nYou can always start an in-app payment investigation for a SWIFT transfer which hasn’t arrived to or from your account. Just follow the simple steps [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/46954) ️\n\n## How much do SWIFT payments cost?\n\n#### Receiving SWIFT payments (up to €10.000)\n- Easy Savings - free\n- Easy Bank, Easy Money, and Easy Green - €5\n\n#### Receiving SWIFT payments (between €10.000 and €100.000)\n- Easy Savings - free\n- Easy Bank, Easy Money, and Easy Green - €10\n\n#### Receiving Swift payments (above €100.000)\n- Easy Savings - free\n- Easy Bank, Easy Money, and Easy Green - €25\n\n## Wise \n\nWhen you’d like to send a SWIFT payment, you can use the services of our partner Wise \n\nWise makes it faster and cheaper than traditional banks to send and receive payments. You can always rely on our app’s built-in integration with Wise to send money to foreign accounts. You can learn all about how it works [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/5149)! \n\n## Related topics \n\n- [What is bunq's BIC/SWIFT code?](https://together.bunq.com/d/1511)\n- [What is bunq's Local Currencies BIC/SWIFT code?](https://together.bunq.com/d/4907)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "I sent a transfer but the recipient hasn’t received it - what should I do?\n\n\nHey bunqers \n\nWhen you send a payment from your bunq account, we'll process it right away and send it to the receiving bank. It can then take a couple of days for the payment to arrive to the receiving bank account. \n\nIf you have a suspicion that your transfer hasn’t arrived yet, here’s some things to consider:\n\n\n### 1. Take into account the waiting time for your transfer’s processing\n\nSince some banks work with different transferring channels, some transfers may take longer to process than others. Usually, bank transfers between banks in the SEPA Region take 1 to 2 business days to arrive to the recipient.\n\n* Learn all about the processing times for outgoing transfers [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/50020-when-will-my-outgoing-payment-arrive) \n\n### 2. Check with the recipient\n\nYou can always contact the recipient to see if they’ve received the transfer or have received an indication that the transfer is on its way. \n\nYou can also advise them to check their online banking app or export a bank statement to check if the payment has entered their account officially. \n\n### 3. The transfer hasn’t arrived even after the normal processing time is up, what next?\n\nIn such case, you can export a single transaction statement and provide it to the recipient as a proof that the transaction has left your account (and our system too). Then the recipient should request a payment investigation from their relevant bank and provide the same statement to them for further reference. \n\nIf the receiving bank requests more information regarding the missing transfer, which cannot be found in the app, be sure to contact our [Support Team](https://together.bunq.com/d/32181-how-do-i-contact-support) and ask them for further assistance \n\n## Related topics: \n\n- [How do I contact Support](https://together.bunq.com/d/32181-how-do-i-contact-support) \n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "Why am I not receiving Cashback?\n\nHey bunqers \n\nYou’ve used your Credit Mastercard at a restaurant, bar or for your public transport ticket and didn’t receive Cashback? There can be a couple of reasons behind this issue. For your ease, we’ve listed all of them in this topic!\n\n### Check your Payday settings\n\nIf your Payday toggle is disabled, you won’t receive Cashback. This toggle is automatically enabled, but it’s worth checking it. The sub-account you’re going to receive your Payday on is your billing account. Further information about how you can enable this feature can be found [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/57060)\n\n### Merchant’s Category Code isn’t eligible \n\nCashback is earned on eligible payments, determined by the Merchant Category Code assigned by Mastercard. If the merchant has been assigned with a different Merchant Category Code that falls outside of [this list](https://together.bunq.com/d/57721), your payment won’t be eligible for Cashback.\n\n### You’ve reached your limit\n\nThere’s a limit of €500 Cashback you can earn per year. After this limit has been reached, you won’t receive Cashback even if the card payment is an eligible one. \n\n### The payment wasn’t settled or it was refunded\n\nCashback is earned only on fully settled payments. If the payment still wasn’t claimed by the merchant, the Cashback feature won’t be triggered. \n\nRefunded payments also won’t receive Cashback. \n\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [What is bunq Payday?](https://together.bunq.com/d/57060)\n- [What's Cashback and how does it work?](https://together.bunq.com/d/57093)\n- [Which payments are eligible for Cashback?](https://together.bunq.com/d/57721)\n- [How is Cashback calculated and paid out?](https://together.bunq.com/d/57722)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "How can I pay direct debits with bunq?\n\nHey bunqers \n\nAccept, decline and manage all of your direct debits with just a few clicks! Sounds cool, right? You can now manage all of your direct debits with bunq faster and easier than ever, check out more info on how you can do this below.\n\n### What are SEPA Business to Business (B2B) Direct Debits and how do I accept them?\n\nNormally, accepting a business to business direct debit requires you to send a signed form to your bank and, after acceptance, it can't be easily changed. We decided to do this differently- when another company sends a mandate form you can simply write down your bunq IBAN and send it back to them, no need to send us a copy! \n\nWhen the company then gives the form to their bank, they'll send the first direct debit. You'll see this as an event in the app, which you can accept or decline. It's that easy! \n\nUpon accepting the mandate you’ll accept all future direct debits from that party and the limit is automatically set based on the original amount. You can always change the limit of both the mandate and your bank account at any time.\n\n---\n\n## Did you receive a direct debit on your bunq bank account? \n\n- **Personal direct debits:** *You have five days* to accept or decline before it expires and is automatically declined. \n\n- **Business direct debits (B2B):** *you have 1 day (24 hours)* to accept or decline before it expires and is automatically accepted or declined based on your settings. \n\n- You're always able to select another sub-account, **for both** paying directly or upcoming recurring direct debits.\n\nFind out how to pay Direct Debits and learn how to accept all future Direct Debits in the steps below:\n\n1. Home\n2. Tap on Events\n3. Select the awaiting event\n4. You can choose between Always accepting this Direct debit or to Accept only this direct debit\n5. Enter your security code\n6. Done  \n\n----\n## What to do if a direct debit got accidentally declined?\n\n\n In this case, you can **contact the debiting company** and transfer the amount you owe manually.\n\n---\n\n## How to manage my Direct Debits?\n\nYou can easily manage your direct debits with the following steps:\n\n1. **Open** the bunq app\n2. Tap on your **Sub-account**\n3. Tap on **Settings** in the top right corner\n4. Choose **Auto Accepted payments**\n5. Choose Direct Debits\n6. Choose the preferred direct debit\n7. You can change the limit or delete the merchant from this list\n\n**Please note that only the owner of the accepted direct debit can change the limit**\n\n---\n\n## How do I set it up with the company that offers the service?\n\nIf a company makes use of B2B Direct Debits, they'll send you a form to fill out. Normally you'll send this form back to the company and a copy to us (the debiting bank). With bunq you don't do the 2nd part and only return the form to the company (Creditor). The company will inform their bank to submit the debit request and you'll get a push notification in the bunq app and have 1 day to accept the mandate.\n\n## How do I set it up in the app?\n\nNo need to set anything up, just wait for the 1st Direct Debit request to appear on your timeline and accept the request. You have 1 day to accept the request.\n\n### What if I don't have enough funds for an accepted Direct Debit?\n\nIn this case, the Direct Debit will not be accepted yet and you will instead get a Request for it. You then have 5 days to accept the Request and pay the Direct Debit. If you don't accept the request within the 5 days, the Direct Debit will automatically be declined and it will not be paid.\n\nFollow the steps below to learn how to do this:\n\n1. Go to  Home\n2. Tap on Events\n3. Tap on the awaiting event\n4. Try to Accept it > Error \n5. Select Top up balance\n6. Choose your Top-up method\n7. Top up you account and you are all set ✅\n\n## Who can use this feature?\n\nEvery Easy Bank, Easy Money and Easy Green user.\n\n## Can I refund a B2B SDD?\n\nNo, B2B Direct Debits are non-refundable. Make sure that the mandate reference and creditor ID correspond with the documents you signed.\n\n## Does B2B SDD conflict with my daily limits?\n\nWe set the limit to the amount of the 1st debit request and you can adjust this limit. If any of your limits are bridged, you'll have the opportunity to approve the debit request again, updating the limit for future requests.\n\n## Can I go below 0 through a B2B SDD?\n\nNo, if you don't have sufficient funds on your account the B2B Direct Debit not go through and we give you a day to top up and accept the debit.\n\n## Does this mean I can issue SDDs and send them to consumers?\n\nNo. That's still on the wishlist and can be done by a PSP in the meantime, for instance Buckaroo/Mollie\n\n## I've already approved the SDD, but the app always tells me to authorize each payment. Why is this happening?\n\nDirect Debits are whitelisted (automatically approved) by a combination of IBAN and the MandateID. If the same company sends a user a new Direct debit from the same IBAN, but the MandateID is different, the payment will need to be accepted manually instead of it happening automatically.\n\n## I can't select between all of my Bank Accounts to pay the SDD from?\n\nYou can only pay or accept the SDD with Bank Accounts from the same account you've received the SDD on.\n\n## Can I pay the SDD with my Savings Account?\n\nNo, you can’t make regular day-to-day payments with your Savings Account, which also includes the paying of SDD payments. \n\n## Related topics \n\n- [How do I auto-accept direct debits?](https://together.bunq.com/d/49548)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "濾 bunq wins historic court case!\n\n\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nToday, October 18, 2022, the Dutch court ruled in favor of bunq using modern technology to effectively combat money laundering!\n\nThe direct result of this ruling paves the way for industry-wide progress that will make banking safer for everyone.\n\nFrom the very beginning, we founded bunq to challenge what banking is and what it could be. Being innovators at heart, we’ve always argued for more effective ways to combat fraud and money laundering. Our engineers built risk-based methods and incorporated advanced technology such as Artificial Intelligence to combat fraud smarter and more efficiently.\n\nHowever, the Dutch National Bank (DNB) rejected these methods, instead forcing us to use theirs, which in our eyes were antiquated, ineffective and actually harmed the stability of the banking system as a whole. Aware of the long term consequences DNB’s methods would have, we decided to take DNB to court on the use of modern technology in the fight against money laundering.\n\nThe Dutch court ruled firmly in favor of our technology-driven philosophy today, opening the door to a safer and more user-friendly financial sector.\n\n## Related topic\n\n- [Why is bunq safe and reliable?](https://together.bunq.com/d/868-why-is-bunq-safe-and-reliable)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "I received a garnishment on my French account \n\nHey bunqers \n\n### What's a garnishment?\n\nIf you have an outstanding debt to an individual, institution, or entity (also known as a creditor), they may obtain a court order to recover the money you owe. This process is called garnishment. According to French law, a garnishment allows the garnishor (the party that’s owed money) to legally force the garnishee (the debtor) to fulfill their financial obligations to the relevant creditor.\n\n## What happens if your French account received a garnishment?\n\n#### Step 1. We’ll let you know\n\nWhen we’re contacted by a creditor (a bailiff, an institution, a Creditor or acreditor’s representative) and receive the administrative enforceable documents from them, we put the bank account in question under garnishment by temporarily freezing your monetary account(s)  and inform you right away in the app.\n\nTo check your received messages from bunq, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to Profile\n2. Click on “See More” under Activity\n3. Check out the messages sent there\n\n#### Step 2. Seizure\n\nWhile we’re processing the garnishment, we temporarily freeze your monetary account(s). We will transfer funds from your account into a special bunq intermediary account where they will be reserved for the creditor. We can only seize funds that are above the free-feet amount (unseizable funds by law) and up to the amount of your garnishment. \n\nIn case there isn’t enough money to cover the debt, we will need to keep your monetary account(s) frozen until enough funds are available to settle the garnishment.\n\nIn any case we will proceed with the transfer of the seized funds to the bailiff (either directly from your account or from the intermediary account - depending on the case) \n\nUsually we wait for a document from the bailiff to transfer the seized amount from our internal account (where your seized funds are stored) to the bailiff's account.\n\n#### Step 3. Unfreezing your Bank Accounts\n\nWhen the procedure above is completed, or we receive an explicit request from the creditor, we'll unfreeze your monetary account(s). Then you can use your bunq account as usual.\n\nIf the debt is decreased or you have settled it by means other than bunq, we must receive an official written statement from the creditor where it’s stated that the proceedings were completed and bunq is at liberty to release the monetary accounts or return any seized funds.\n\n## When will my account be unblocked?\n\nThis depends on the instructions of the bailiff. To have your account unblocked, please contact the bailiff or agree the amounts (enough to fulfill the debt) to be paid and request a release of the seizure provided by the creditor.\n\n## Is there an administration fee for a garnishment?\n\nBy French law, bunq is required to process every garnishment. Since this is fully regulated by the French law, we process garnishment(s) free of charge.\n\n## I have another question about a garnishment placed on my account. Who do I contact?\n\nWe've shared the available details about the garnishment, including the file number and the creditor's name, in the garnishment announcement. For more specific advice and assistance, it would be best to reach out to the bailiff directly. They'll be able to provide you with more detailed information.\n\n## When will my garnishment finish?\n\nAs soon as a judge rules on the garnishment, we’ll receive the verdict and when we have the needed transfer order, we’ll immediately process all needed payments.\n\n## How can I appeal?\n\nAs a third-party, we don't handle objections or other requests related to the garnishment. These matters are managed by the institution or the bailiff who placed the garnishment. If you have any further questions, it’ll be best to contact the bailiff about them.\n\n## What if I have more than one garnishment?\n\nWhen you have multiple garnishments, your account will be blocked until all of the garnishment proceedings are completed.\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [I received a garnishment on my Dutch account ](https://together.bunq.com/d/23452)\n- [I received a garnishment on my German account ](https://together.bunq.com/d/51579)\n\nWant to learn more?

Once reversed, the funds can be sent to another active account   \n\n## When will my funds bounce back?\n\nIt’s possible that the reversal may take 1-2 business days for SEPA transfers and up to 7 business days for SWIFT.

Sometimes the funds might get stuck while bouncing back due to technical error on the cooperating bank’s side. \n\n## I sent a payment to a bunq Bank Account when it was closed, but now I reactivated it. Will the funds still arrive? \n\nThe answer here in most cases is no. When you make the transfer and it gets processed by the cooperating bank, our system automatically declines the payment at the moment of processing. \n\nThis means that even if the Bank Account is reactivated right after the transfer, the possibility of receiving the funds is little to none.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [When will my outgoing payment arrive?](https://together.bunq.com/d/50020)\n- [SWIFT payments - what is this and how does it work?](https://together.bunq.com/d/48261)\n- [In-app Payment Investigations ️‍♂️](https://together.bunq.com/d/46954)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "I was declared as Bankrupt/Insolvent in Germany or the Netherlands\n\nHey bunqers \n\n### What is bankruptcy/ insolvency?\n\nBankruptcy is a legal process where an individual or entity declares an inability to repay outstanding debts. Once declared bankrupt/insolvent a curator/insolvency administrator is always appointed by the relevant court to manage your funds. \n\nIf this happens to you in the Netherlands or Germany, bunq is legally obliged to block all liable monetary accounts which belong to the natural person and/or all liable company/ies.\n\n## What’s the difference?\n\n#### In Germany  \n\nAt this point you’re no longer authorized to make use of your bank balances. Your insolvency administrator will be the one handling all your funds until the legal proceedings are concluded or bunq is provided with a written document from the insolvency administrator or the relevant court for the release of the monetary accounts covered by the insolvency.\n\n#### In the Netherlands  \n\nAt this point you’re no longer authorized to make use of your bank balances;our curator will be the one handling all your funds until a court order is announced in the Dutch public bankruptcy register or provided to us by the curator.\n\n## What’s next?\n\n#### Step 1: We’ll let you know\n\nWe can be made aware of your bankruptcy or insolvency case if:\n- we’re contacted by a curatortor an insolvency administrator\n- information is published in the [bankruptcy registry](https://www.rechtspraak.nl/Onderwerpen/Schulden/Faillissement) \n\n Once bunq receives all the necessary documentation we will block all available monetary accounts in your name (including unlimited liable company account(s) under your name)\n\nYour account(s) will have to remain blocked until we receive a request to unblock one or all available monetary accounts by the court-appointed curator or insolvency administrator. We’ll immediately inform you about this update via an in-app message. To check your received messages from bunq, you can follow these simple steps:\n\n1. Go to Profile\n2. Click on “See More” under Activity\n3. Check out the messages sent there\n4. The time your account will remain blocked solely depends on the decisions of your curator/insolvency administrator.\n\n#### Step 2: Seizure\n\nThroughout this whole process, we comply with a variety of requests which your  curator or insolvency administrator may have, keeping in mind the limitations of the applicable law.\n\nWhen the curator or insolvency administrator requests transfer of all available funds in your liable Bank Accounts, we’ll transfer the amounts to the dedicated bank account created for the purpose of resolving your bankruptcy or insolvency case.\n\n#### Step 3: Unlocking your Bank Accounts\n\nThere are two ways to get your account unblocked and released from bankruptcy or insolvency.\n- A court order from the same court that initially declared the bankruptcy or insolvency now declares that the proceedings have ended and the account(s) can be reactivated. \n- Your curator or insolvency administrator can contact us with a request to reactivate your account(s) by providing us with the court order.\n\n\n## Can the curator/insolvency administrator request termination of my bunq bank account?\n\nYes, the curator/insolvency administrator has the legal right to request the permanent termination of your bank account with all available monetary accounts in it, which is a request we’re obliged to comply with.\n\n## When will my account be unblocked?\n\nAs a third-party, our access to information is limited and is solely based on what is provided by the curator. Therefore, the handling of this matter is subject to the instructions given by the curator.\n\n## When will my bankruptcy (in the Netherlands) or insolvency (in Germany) end?\n\nAs soon as a judge rules on the release of a particular monetary account or termination of your whole bankruptcy procedure. When that happens, we must receive the written verdict from said curator/insolvency administrator.\n\n## How can I appeal?\n\nWe've shared the available details about the bankruptcy/ insolvency. For more specific advice and assistance, it would be best to contact your curator/insolvency administrator. They'll be able to provide you with more detailed information.\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [I received a garnishment on my German account ](https://together.bunq.com/d/51579)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "Update on banking services for Russia and Belarus\n\nHey bunqers,\n\nAs a bank, we're legally required to follow and apply all sanctions imposed by the European Union. These can have an impact on your daily banking activities if you have Belarusian or Russian nationality. All measures taken in response to these sanctions and when they apply are explained below.\n\n### Why do we do this?\n\nThe sanctions mentioned in this article are synchronized as per:\n\n- Council Regulation (EU) 2022/328, Article 5b and 5f for Russian nationals\n- Council Regulation (EU) 2022/398 Article 1u and 1z for Belarussian nationals \n\nIf you believe that any of the sanctions are applied incorrectly, you can always contact us directly through the [Support center](https://together.bunq.com/d/32181) for further assistance. \n\n## Account balance limitations \n\nYour total account balance is limited to €100,000 due to sanction-related regulations for non-EU residents. Keep in mind that the limit is applicable to all of your sub-accounts and Savings Accounts (including Joint). This means that you can only deposit a total of up to €100,000 across all of your accounts.\n\n\n## Closing your bunq Account\n\nIn case you're not following bunq’s Terms & Conditions (where all the sanction-related regulations are listed), we have the right to suspend and close your bunq account. You can learn more about this [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/26054)\n\n## Exemption from sanctions \n\nYou’re exempt from the sanctions if you have a temporary or permanent residence permit that is valid in the European Union, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland. A valid passport or identity card issued in any of the aforementioned areas is also acceptable. \n\nIf any of the above sanctions are applied to your account but you believe this is incorrect, please reach out to us via [Support](https://together.bunq.com/d/32181) so that we can assist you further. We aim to resolve such cases and remove restrictions from your account as soon as possible.\n\n## ID verification\n\nAs a Belarusian or Russian national, your identity verification request will be reviewed individually. Keep in mind that, in some cases, your ID verification may take longer due to regulations and the legal document requirements.\n\n* Learn more about the opening of your account [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/47908)\n* Learn more about the accepted identity documents [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/3355)\n\n## International funds transfer\n\nWe have adopted a measure concerning SWIFT transfers to prevent large-amount transfers from Russia and Belarus to Europe. That’s why we actively monitor international transfers to your account. This can mean that some transactions to your account are stopped. We review these transactions on hold as soon as possible, usually within 48 hours, and may ask for some additional information regarding your transfer. Learn more about this [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/48483)\n\nOn occasion, the review can take up to 7 days. We will make sure to keep you in the loop every step of the way!\n\nAlso, keep in mind that in March 2022, a number of Russian and Belarusian banks were excluded from the SWIFT international payment system. Please see the list of excluded sanctioned banks at the bottom of this page.\n\n## How are partner services affected?\n\n\n### Currency Cloud service regulations\n\nCurrencyCloud, our partners for Local Currencies, won’t process transfers to and from Russia and Belarus until further notice. This means that your Local Currencies accounts can’t send or receive transfers from Russia and Belarus from 9th of March, 2022, 12:00 CET onwards. \n\n### Wise service regulations \n\nWise informed their customers and partners that from the 1st of March, 2022, they’ve deactivated their services for Russia and Belarus in RUB currency. This means that you can't send or receive transfers from Russia using Wise. \n\n### Mastercard service suspension\n\nIn an [official statement](https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/2022/march/mastercard-statement-on-suspension-of-russian-operations/) on their official website, Mastercard announced the suspension of all of their services in Russia. This means that your Mastercard won’t operate when used at Russian ATM machines or merchants.\n\n## List of banks that we are unable to process SWIFT payments from:\n\n**For Russia** \n- VTB (VTBR.MM)\n- Bank Otkritie\n- Novikombank\n- Promsvyazbank (PSKBI.MM)\n- Bank Rossiya\n- Sovcombank \n- VEB\n- Sberbank\n- Credit Bank of Moscow\n- Russian Agricultural Bank\n\n**For Belarus** \n- Belagroprombank\n- Bank Dabrabyt\n- the Development Bank of the Republic of Belarus \n- Belarusian Bank For Development And Reconstruction\n- also including all of the mentioned above Belarusian subsidiaries\n\n**Important note:** The Intermediary bank makes the final ruling if a certain transfer is sent successfully, therefore some other banks not mentioned above may experience unsuccessful transactions too.\n__________\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [We stand for peace](https://together.bunq.com/d/47868-we-stand-for-peace)\n- [Update for Ukrainian refugees](https://together.bunq.com/d/47908-update-for-ukrainian-refugees)\n- [Local Currencies](https://together.bunq.com/d/45414-local-currencies/9)\n- [Wise Payments FAQ](https://together.bunq.com/d/4957-wise-payments-faq/5)\n\nIf you’re in need of help, willing and able to help others in the war affected region or want to donate, reach out to the [People for People](https://www.peopleforpeople.info) foundation, co-founded by bunq to connect people who can provide help to those who need it – Ukrainians and Russians alike.\n",

With this in mind, we monitor activity and transactions on all bunq accounts, to prevent any misuse of our services. Upon review, we may request extra info and documentation from our users as mentioned and explained in Chapter 9. Eligibility and account requirements of our [Terms & Conditions](https://www.bunq.com/documents/business#toc-35).\n\n**Such inquiries are based on:**\n\n- Our legal obligations to perform continuous customer due diligence\n- The WWFT (Wet ter voorkoming van witwassen en financieren van terrorisme)\n- All related and equivalent European legislation and law\n\n### How does the process work?\n\nAs a bank, we’re required to understand how you use your Business bunq account. For this, we might have to ask you a few questions or provide additional documentation to help maintain a safe banking environment and follow the regulations mentioned above.\n\nWe will send you an inquiry via the in-app chat asking some more details and documents if needed, regarding your account use and activities. This is a regular routine check process required by any bank, so if you receive such an inquiry, there’s nothing to be bothered about.\n\nOnce the needed info is provided from your side, our relevant team will review it for you and will return back to you as soon as possible.\n\n**Note:** Please have in mind that for more extensive document and information requests we may reach out via review@bunq.com.\n\n## What’s requested in such a case?\n\nSince we need to have a clear record of your source(s) of income and the activities on your account, we will ask questions related to these. These are the most common information and documentation we could require from you:\n\n#### Account purpose and usage inquiry\n\nWhen we’re inquiring about the purpose of your bunq Business account, we may ask:\n\n- How do you generate your sales?\n- Who are your main suppliers/clients ?\n- Which markets do you operate in?\n- Do you expect to perform cross-border transactions?\n- Which part of your business do you use bunq for?\n- Do you have a website or other online platforms linked to your business? If yes, please share with us.\n\n#### Source of funds inquiry\n\nWhen we’re inquiring about your company's source of funds / source of wealth, we could request:\n\n- invoices issued in the normal course of business\n- contracts with your main suppliers or clients\n- tax statement documentation\n- financial reports for the last calendar year.\n\n#### Payment inquiry\n\nWhen we’re inquiring about a specific payment, we’d request you to provide us with supporting documentation regarding this payment, according to its description.\n\nFor example, if the description is related to an invoice payment, you can provide a copy of the merchant’s invoice you’re paying. Or in case the payment is related to a contract, the contract would be sufficient proof.\n\nIn any case, please provide us with accurate detailed information which will help us best understand your account activities and will minimize the duration of our inquiry and review process.\n\n## Does this mean my bunq account will be closed?\n\nWe’d never terminate a bunq account without further explanation, since account termination is something we take seriously.\n\nWe’d deactivate an account only if regulations weren’t followed (you can find all regulations and refer further to our [Terms & Conditions](https://www.bunq.com/documents/business#toc-35).\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [Income information required - what should I do?] (https://together.bunq.com/d/47673) \n- [Why we sometimes need information about your account use?](https://together.bunq.com/d/17142) \n- [I need to provide documents in the bunq app](https://together.bunq.com/d/48614) \n- [How do I submit payment documents?](https://together.bunq.com/d/48483) \n\nWant to learn more?

You can learn more about which card would suit your lifestyle the best [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/12503) \n\nSee what's the difference between the Debit and Credit cards [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/3722) \n\n## Maestro is going out of production in 2024, what does that mean? \n\nThe Dutch Payments Association and Mastercard announced that Maestro cards will be stopped from production in the upcoming years. Therefore, they expect most stores in the Netherlands to accept Mastercard Debit cards by the end of 2023.\n\nThis means that your Credit card should be accepted in every Dutch store really soon. Woohoo! \n\n## Related topics \n\n- [What’s the difference between Credit, Debit and Metal Card?](https://together.bunq.com/d/3722)\n- [How do I order a card?](https://together.bunq.com/d/2936)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "Why was my account blocked?\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nDid you receive a message from our Compliance Team saying that your account has been blocked or is under review? \n\nIf so, it means we’ve decided to temporarily suspend your account. We take security seriously here at bunq, and have placed your account under review to make sure your money stays safe. Keep reading to see why this might have happened.  \n\n### Why do we restrict accounts?\n\nAs a bank, we're legally required to protect our users’ accounts and the integrity of our banking system. To make sure everything stays safe, we pay close attention to how our customers use their accounts. This helps us identify anything suspicious, and flag any activity that could present a problem. \n\nWhenever we recognize suspicious activity that goes against our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.bunq.com/terms), we take immediate action. This helps keep your account safe, and protects your data. \n\nPlease be assured that we’ll never intentionally freeze or close an account although the laws prevent us from sharing additional details. Thank you for your understanding \n\n## What happens when my account is restricted?\n\nSometimes bunq may temporarily restrict your bunq account(s). That could mean either a complete restriction for all the incoming and outgoing payments or a partial restriction for the outgoing payments only. \n\nYou'll always receive a notification for such blocking of your account(s).\n\n## Does this mean my account with bunq will be terminated?\n\nThe short answer is no. Each case is reviewed by our dedicated team and processed in line with our policies and legal requirements. We won’t terminate your account without further notification. However there’s certain information that we’re not legally allowed to share with you.\n\nYou can find more details in our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.bunq.com/policies/terms/personal) \n\n## What’s the reason for my account's restriction?\n\nSee the possible reasons [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/49541)\n\n\n## What can you do?\n\nYou can check [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/49538)\n\n## Can I still receive money on a blocked account? \n\nIn case of permanent account closure, all incoming payments made during the review period will be returned to their sender.\n\n## What happens with my money once my bunq account is terminated?\n\nIn case we’ve determined that your bunq account usage differs substantially from what’s considered a regular day-to-day banking behavior, we may take actions on your account closure and you won’t be able to receive any incoming payments afterwards. This means that all transactions sent to your account will bounce back to the sender.\n\nAs to all funds remaining on your account, there are 2 case scenarios: \n\n* 1st case scenario\n\nAny remaining funds in your account(s) that is rightful to you will be returned for which you’ll receive an email with instructions to claim your funds as explained in our [Terms & Conditions](https://www.bunq.com/legal/personal#toc-53). You’ll have 45 days to collect your funds via the bunq.to link we'll send you through email. If you fail to claim your funds, please reach out to our Support team for further assistance and provide your EEA IBAN account details for a refund.\n\n* 2nd case scenario\n\nAny remaining funds in your account(s) will be held after closure for an initial period of 4 months in order to cover any outstanding payments or fees, pre-approved payments, or rightful claims of third parties. \n\nWithin this period we’re performing additional reviews to help you get your funds back. We may further extend this period if we need additional input from third parties.\n\nAs soon as we have additional information and when we confirm that your funds can be returned to you, we will inform you accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [What's a Suspicious activity?](https://together.bunq.com/d/49540-whats-suspicious-activity)\n- [My account was blocked on request of my legal guardian.

Overview of bunq Update 18\n\n- **What's new with the latest bunq Update?**\n\nWith this Update we made sure to focus on two main actionables: provide you with a better local banking experience and improve the app. Now you can add a local European IBAN to your existing bunq account and our Spanish users can get a Spanish IBAN for the best local experience \n\nYou can check the most important questions below so that you can learn more on how to bank like a local and also how to use the improved features we prepared for you. \n\nMake sure to check out the rest of features we prepared for you [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/45251) ✨\n\n## 2. Bank like a local  \n\n- **What’s Local IBAN and how do I use it** \n\nTo bank like a local, you need a local IBAN. Now you can create your own local IBAN while you keep your Dutch IBAN. Learn more about this [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/45253). \n\n- **And how does the Local IBAN invoicing work?**\n\nWhen you apply for a foreign sub-account, we have to run some more checks and this can include an additional verification to comply with the local regulations. This is why we charge our personal users  a small one-time fee of €9,99 and business users - €29.99. This fee is applied for each Local branch you choose. \n\n- **How does the Local currencies BETA feature work?**\n\nIf you’re among the first 100 users, you’ll get access to the Local Currencies feature and can report bugs and suggest improvements during the BETA period.  \n\nWhile you’re using the Beta feature, we’d love to hear your feedback, as well as any bugs you might run into. You can learn more on how to get your BETA version now [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/45257)\n\n- **How can I get a Spanish IBAN as a Spanish resident?**\n\nSimply open a new sub-account or visit the address settings to get started \nYou can check more info on how to get your Spanish IBAN easily [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/45249)\n\n- **Can I keep using my existing NL IBANs when I get my Spanish IBAN?**\n\nWhen switching to Spanish IBANs as a Spanish resident this will automatically apply to all your new sub-accounts. However you’re free to keep using your existing Dutch IBANs as usual! \n\n- **Is it mandatory to switch to ES IBANs for Spanish residents?**\n\nYou can keep bunqing as usual with your Dutch IBANs. Looking for Spanish IBANs at a later moment?  Simply visit the address settings to get started\n\n## 3. Improved App\n\n- **What’s new with the Profile tab?**\n\nHave access to everything you need easily! Now on the Profile tab you can see your Trophies, exclusive Deals that save you money, Tribes, Add-ons and Common Goals. All with a new and cleaner design. We moved the Events to the Home tab for your convenience. \n\n- **Never miss a direct debit! How direct debit reminders work?**\n\nTo make sure that you always accept the direct debits in time we will make sure to send you a reminder that this payment request is about to expire \nYou can choose to either always accept your direct debits or accept them manually. Learn more about how to set this up [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/45254)\n\n- **Let me show you how that works!**\n\nOur app is intuitive and our Together pages are always updated but sometimes a little hand from our support team is required! We're here to show you exactly how to find what you need. For more details about it check [this topic](https://together.bunq.com/d/45247)\n\n- **App search? How can I search through the app?**\n\nOn any tab in the app you will see our magical search bar✨\nGet to any feature, setting or payment in no time, simply by starting a search from anywhere in your bunq app. \n\nIf you have an iOS device - simply scroll down the screen and the search bar will appear.

That’s why we made sure to come up with an internal process, which ensures that in case of data breach all regulations are met and you’re informed right away. \n\n### What's a data breach?\n\nA data breach is a security incident where personal data is compromised, leading to a breach in confidentiality, availability, or integrity. If such a breach occurs and it has high risk for our users, we would communicate the matter to the Dutch Supervisory Authority no later than 72 hours after becoming aware of the breach. \n\nThe following situations constitute a Personal Data Breach:\n\n- Confidentiality breach - where there is an unauthorized or accidental disclosure of, or access to, personal data\n\n- Availability breach - where there is an accidental or unauthorized loss of access to, or destruction of, personal data\n\n- Integrity breach - where there is an unauthorized or accidental alteration of personal data\n\n## What happens in such a case? \n\n1. If such breach occurs, our employees are required to inform the Data Protection Officer as soon as possible.\n\n2. The Data Protection Officer determines if the Personal Data Breach is still ongoing and ensures that appropriate steps are taken immediately to contain and minimize the impact of the Personal Data Breach. \n\n3. The Data Protection Officer will determine if a particular Personal Data Breach should be notified to the Dutch Data Protection Authority. If necessary the Personal Data Breach will be notified to the Dutch Data Protection Authority as soon as possible but no later than 72 hours using the online form.\n\n## Is my data protected? \n\nAbsolutely!

    "source_text" : "Can I receive payments in another currency or from outside the SEPA region?\n\n\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nYes, you can send/receive payments to your bunq account from another bank account outside of the SEPA Region! \n\n### How does it work?\n\nAll you need to do is make sure that the **sending bank converts the amount of the payment into euros** before sending the payment to your bunq account. If a payment using a different currency reaches bunq, it will get bounced back automatically as we only support euros as a currency.\n\n\n## What can be done if the payment bounces back?\n\nAlternatively you can use [Wise](https://together.bunq.com/d/5149). It's up to 8x cheaper than the traditional way of transferring money.  \n\n## What if I have a Local Currency account?\n\nIf you have a Local Currency sub-account opened, you can receive funds in the relevant currency without any hassle! Further information about Local Currency sub-accounts can be found [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/45414).\n\nKeep in mind that even with a Local Currencies account, the transfers are still SWIFT payments. It takes time for these payments to arrive. SWIFT payments can take up to 5 days. There are also fees involved in receiving a SWIFT payment.

Further more, you have 4 free withdrawals per month. After this, you'll be charged €0.99 per withdrawal.\n\n## Who can use Barzahlen/Viacash?\n\nbunq Personal and Business users [with Easy Bank, Easy Money, Easy Green plans] living in  Germany or  Austria or bunq users with the previously mentioned plans who travel to the available countries.\n\n## Can I use this service if I'm traveling to Germany or Austria?\n\nYes!

They only provide service in  Germany and  Austria at this time, but we'll be sure to update you if this ever changes. \n\nUsers residing in **Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden** can top up using cash via PaysafeCash.

When it expires, you'll get a push saying it expired and you can just make a new barcode if you need to.\n\n## How can I cancel a failed Barzahlen withdrawal/deposit?\n\nWithdrawal/deposit can't be canceled right now due to a limitation on Barzahlen's side, so that they've the time to verify if the withdrawal or deposit actually happened or not before allowing it to be canceled. After 48 hours the event will either be canceled automatically, or you'll be able to cancel it manually from the bunq app. You should immediately be able to make a new withdrawal/deposit\n\n## Barzahlen offers more deposit points than your application, why is that?\n\nYes, indeed there are more points that are operated by Barzahlen, but we suggest using the ones shown within our application. If a particular location is being shown on their website, but not in our app, you can't use it. The reasoning behind is that those points only allow deposits up to €100.00, and for us in order to fully support that location, we'd have to limit every transaction to €100.00. We want to be flexible towards you and enable you to withdraw and deposit more than €100.00.\n\n## How long does it take before my deposit is in my account?\n\nAs soon as the retailer confirms the deposit, it should be straight in your account.\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [How do I top up my account with cash?](https://together.bunq.com/d/50071)\n- [How to make cash deposits with PaysafeCash ](https://together.bunq.com/d/45741)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "How to recognize fraud and stay safe?\n\n\n\n\nHey bunqers \n\nAs you know, bunq takes the security of your personal information very seriously  We’ve already shared some tips on how to keep you and your money safe here, but we thought it might help to provide some more tips to to help you recognize fraud.\n\n**Important Note:** bunq would never contact you via phone or ask for your credentials, magic links or any personal information (phone number, email, security code, card number, IBAN, etc.) outside the bunq app.\n\n### What to do if you became a victim of fraud or you are suspecting fraud?\n\n- Check your bank account frequently, and always read your bankmail swiftly after receiving it. If you've been a victim of fraud, contact your bank immediately.\n- If you suspect fraud, please give а notice to your bank about your suspicions.\n- If you suspect a bunq user to be involved with fraud or scams, you can report it through the form [here](https://www.bunq.com/report/fraud).\n- Fill out [this form](https://www.bunq.com/report) to report your incident and help us to fight fraud!\n- If you have a card payment on your bunq account that you don’t recognize or it was a result of fraud, you can easily follow the steps in-app explained [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/23367).\n\n## Phishing\n\nPhishing is an attempt by fraudsters to obtain your personal information, such as passwords or security details. The fraudsters often disguise themselves as a trustworthy party by using fake websites that look just like legitimate websites. The general lay-out as well as the link are often almost exactly the same. These websites are very good at making you believe they are sending a genuine email from (for example) your bank or an online payment processor, when in fact it is fake.\n\nIf you receive an email or other messages that resemble bunq’s normal messages, in which you are asked to follow a link and log in, or share your login codes or other security information, **please do not follow these instructions.**\n\nbunq will never ask for your login codes or security features either by phone (we don’t use phone calls as a way of communication), via e-mail, text message, WhatsApp or any form of social media.\n\nIf you don’t trust a website or are unsure, you can always use an external tool to double-check. Here’s a tip: If the website seems to be registered recently, this may be an indication that the website is fraudulent. For more information, check out the following topics we prepared for you for [Phishing](https://together.bunq.com/d/54498) and [Spoofing](https://together.bunq.com/d/45398).\n\n## Old-fashioned phishing\nThis happens when you are entering your PIN in an ATM or at a payment station. Please make sure that no one is watching you and that you always cover your PIN while you are entering it. Afterward, store your passcode safely.\n\n## WhatsApp fraud (Impersonation Scam)\n\nWhatsApp fraud is a form of fraud where someone pretends to be someone you know, and asks you to help them out with the payment of a bill through a Whatsapp message. Usually, the following characteristics apply:\n\n- The “person you know” has a new number and contacts you through Whatsapp; for example, they got their phone lost/stolen, changed their number, etc. but it will always be a situation of urgency\n- They ask you to help them out by paying a bill for them or just some other emergency reason for financial help;\n- Usually, they are in a rush, the bill needs to be paid quickly;\n- They cannot, or do not want to, communicate with you through any other means than Whatsapp.\n\nIf anyone asks you to transfer money, or to pay an existing bill for them, please always contact this person through other means of communication outside of Whatsapp. When you cannot reach this person, do not transfer any money. Scammers usually try to ‘play’ with your emotions and would pretend to be not only just acquaintances but also close family members.\n\nHow can you help stop this kind of fraud? If a link was provided by the scammer make sure to report the IBAN or the link to the police and the bank of the fraudster.\n\n## Fake payment requests\n\nIf you receive a payment request, always make sure to check the validity of the web page the link leads you to. Often fraudsters will use fake internet pages which look very similar to the normal payment environment of a bank, but the website is in fact a fake one. The information you enter in this payment request is directly visible to the fraudsters and might be used to access your bank account.\n\n**Never enter your information if you do not trust the payment link or the person that is sending you the payment request.**\n\n## Marketplace fraud\n\nThere are many times where you will find the item you were looking for on second hand websites. This is great! Second hand items are cheaper and reusing products contributes to a greener world. Unfortunately, sometimes the person who promises to send you the product doesn’t deliver after you have paid.\n\nHow do you recognize these kinds of fraudsters? First, we’d like to emphasise that if something sounds too good to be true, it’s usually because it isn’t true. Always check the market value of the product you want to purchase. If the price of the offered product is too low, this can be a sign that there’s a fraudster at work.\n\n## Investment fraud (Boiler room)\n\nBoiler room fraud is a scam where pushy salespeople trick people into investing in fake or risky companies. They often lie or overstate facts to make the investment look more appealing, risk-free and safe. Sometimes, they even make fake propaganda on social media platforms before calling the victim. After people invest, their money is usually taken away, and they hardly ever get the profits they were promised. To keep yourself safe, be careful with unexpected investment offers, do detailed research, and ask financial experts for advice before investing.\n\n## Don’t become a money mule!\n\nIf anyone reaches out to you to ask you for access to your bank account or to transfer some money through your bank account, never comply with this request, no matter how promising it sounds!\n\nHere's an example: Someone reaches out to you through social media or friends and promises you an amount of money. They promise you this money if you transfer some funds for them, or if they can use your bank account for a few days. They will tell you there is no risk involved, and that it is really easy money.\n\nIt is highly likely that your bank account will be used for criminal activity, for which you will be held (criminally) liable. Consequences of this may be that you will not be able to open bank accounts, get a mortgage or obtain credit and that criminal proceedings may follow.\n\nAgain, please realize that if something sounds too good to be true, this usually is because it is not true.\n\nFor more information on money mules, please check out [this website](https://www.politie.nl/informatie/money-mules-en-de-gevolgen-als-je-wordt-gepakt.html) by the Dutch police.\n\n## Need to report a fraud incident to bunq?\nFill out [this form](https://www.bunq.com/report) to report your incident and help us to fight fraud!\n\n## What to do if you don’t trust a bunq.me link?\n\nIf you receive a bunq.me payment link and you suspect it's fraud, please use the report button to report the page to our compliance team. Our team will immediately take action against the account.\n\n##  Related topics\n\n- [What’s phishing and how to recognize it?](https://together.bunq.com/d/54498) \n- [Spoofing - The progressive ways of scamming nowadays, explained](https://together.bunq.com/d/45398) \n- [I was scammed.

    "source_text" : "Can I receive a SWIFT payment?\n\n\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nYour bunq account processes SWIFT payments without any issues - all Bank Accounts ([Local Currency](https://together.bunq.com/d/45414-local-currencies/9) and [Local IBANs](https://together.bunq.com/d/45253)) can receive SWIFT payments in their relevant currency. \n\n### How long does it take to arrive?\n\nNormally SWIFT payments are received in 2-3 working days, but they can **take up to a week** to arrive. SWIFT payments are more complex and time-consuming to process, so we apply a processing fee. You can find the fee in our [pricing list](http://bunq.com/pricing-sheet)\n\n* Want to learn more about the arrival time of your transaction? Click [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/4295)! \n\n## What is SWIFT?\n\nSWIFT payments are international transfers processed via the SWIFT international payment network unlike regular SEPA payments. This network is one of the largest in the world.  Most of these payments are coming from banks that are not within the [SEPA region](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/integration/retail/sepa/html/index.en.html). \n\nIf you have an [e-money account](https://together.bunq.com/d/30060-what-is-an-e-money-account-and-how-do-i-use-it), we will not be able to process your incoming SWIFT payment, you are required [to fully verify your account](https://together.bunq.com/d/33613-how-long-does-it-take-to-verify-my-paperwork) before your SWIFT payment arrives. If not, it will be returned to the sending bank.\n\n---\n\n## What if my SWIFT payment hasn't arrived?\n\nIf your SWIFT payment has not arrived, we ask that you reach out the sender or sending bank. Please ask them to investigate and provide you with the reference for the payment. You can then [reach out to our Support team](https://together.bunq.com/d/32181-how-do-i-contact-support) with the gathered information and we will do a target search on our end.\n\n---\n## Wise\n\nWhen you would like to send and receive payments in different currencies, we recommend using Wise as an intermediary bank. Wise makes it faster and cheaper than traditional banks to send and receive payments in 39 different currencies!\nYou can also rely on our app’s [built-in integration](https://together.bunq.com/d/5149-what-is-transferwise/2) with Wise to send money to foreign accounts! \n\n---\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- [When will I receive my payment?](https://together.bunq.com/d/4295-when-will-i-receive-my-payment/12)\n- [When will my outgoing payment arrive?](https://together.bunq.com/d/50020-when-will-my-outgoing-payment-arrive)\n- [How do I send transfers and top up with Wise?](https://together.bunq.com/d/5149)\n\nWant to learn more?

Thanks to our extended coverage, it’s even easier to freely send and receive money from any participating Dutch or European bank! All banks fully connected to either RT1 or TIPS are supported.\n\n**Note:** As of November 19, 2023, the upper limit for outgoing instant payments will be raised to €100,000.\n\n## Which banks can I make instant payments to and from?\nbunq is part of 2 pan-European instant payments systems: **_TIPS_** and **_RT1_**. To see if your bank is part of them too, check out the lists of participating banks: \n\n- [TIPS](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/tips/facts/html/index.en.html) (Important - Knab is part of TIPS, however, currently they have only enabled the receiving of instant payments)\n- [RT1](https://www.ebaclearing.eu/services/rt1/participants/)\n\n----\nWe’re proud to be the first challenger bank that enables instant payments across Europe  Simply experience this amazing time saver with your next [payment!](https://together.bunq.com/d/115)\n______      \n\n## Why is this payment not sent as Instant Payment? \n\nThere can be a multitude of causes:\n\n- The 2 banks are on 2 different systems;\n- One of the banks blocks instant payments from or to another for fraud reasons;\n- The receiving bank has specific compliance requirements in place, requiring us to transfer a payment as regular SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT), which takes more time. This is the case for Boursorama Bank [BIC: BOUSFRPPXXX] and Openbank [BIC: OPENESMMXXX].\n\n## Are Instant Payments still possible during the weekend?\n\nHave to make a quick payment over the weekend? Not a problem because Instant Payments are possible between supporting banks, 365 days a year \n\n## Good to know\n\n- Instant Transfers are Instant (max. 10 seconds), more info on that can be found [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/4295)\n- Instant Transfers are processed 24/7 and 365 days of the year.\n- Instant Transfers are included with all our plans (except for [Easy Savings](https://together.bunq.com/d/48095)) ; at no additional costs\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [Does bunq support instant payments?](https://together.bunq.com/d/40305)\n\nWant to learn more?

In other words, it serves as the central bank for all EU countries that have adopted the euro!\n\n### What's European Central Bank's goal? \n\nThe main goal of the ECB is to ensure proper circulation of funds so that the economy keeps on running smoothly. They serve as the man behind the curtain to help maintain stability of the euro.\n\nAs the ECB is the “bank of banks”, they never invest in anything. They don’t have a need to make investments as the ability to print and regulate money is in their own hands. By storing your money with them, you can ensure that it is not being used for shady practices.\n\nIf you want to learn more about ECB and what they do, check out [this link](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/html/index.en.html) for more info!\n\n## Freedom of Choice\n\nAt bunq, we think you should have the freedom to decide what happens with your money.

B2B direct debits\n\nAdditionally, for card payments, we can't refund: \n\n- the transaction concerns a deposit into an investment or crypto currency account\n- the transaction involves or has been executed via e-money wallet (like PayPal or Curve card)\n- the transaction concerns a donation (i.e., a payment to a charity)\n- the transaction was executed on a gambling or betting website.\n- online transaction done with Maestro Cards (due to Mastercard’s fraud prevention guidelines)\n\nIf you're looking for a refund for one of these options, we recommend directly requesting it from the other party.\n\nPlease also take note of our Mastercard refund terms, to be found under clause 9 in ‘bunq card rules’ in our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.bunq.com/policies/terms)\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [Everything about refunds](https://together.bunq.com/d/27036-everything-about-refunds)\n- [How are my refunds processed?](https://together.bunq.com/d/48165)\n- [I need a refund for a card payment - what should I do?](https://together.bunq.com/d/49932)\n- [When can I request a refund and what do I need to do?](https://together.bunq.com/d/49933)\n- [How do I know if I received the refund?](https://together.bunq.com/d/49938)\n- [What can’t be refunded?](https://together.bunq.com/d/49940)\n- [Can I receive my refund to a closed Bank Account or blocked card?](https://together.bunq.com/d/49943)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "I haven’t received my refund yet - what can I do?\n\nHey bunqers \n\nExpecting a refund from a merchant and it still hasn’t arrived? No worries, you’ll receive your funds back! Just make sure to follow the instructions provided below:\n\n* Note: First, make sure to check if your refund has arrived, as explained [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/49938-how-do-i-know-if-i-received-the-refund)\n\n### Take into account the normal waiting time for a refund\nIn case the merchant is processing your refund manually (meaning - you didn’t request it through the app yourself), every kind of refund may take a different amount of time to be processed. This is due to the multiple systems merchants may use and also the ways they process refunds may take more technical time.\n\nYou can check with the merchant on the sending date of the refund and calculate what’s the latest date in which your funds should arrive. \n\n* Make sure to check the different waiting times for incoming payments [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/4295) \n\n## The processing time has passed and the refund is still not with me, what now?\n\nContact the merchant again and ask for the status of your refund and check if there isn’t an error on their end. Best way to communicate with them here is via written form (chat/email), so that you can provide all needed information easily, and in turn receive proof of communication for later stages if needed.\n\nWhen contacting them for the first time, you can provide them with a [bank statement](https://together.bunq.com/d/3207-how-do-i-export-a-bank-statement) proving that the refund isn’t in your account yet. Once the merchant checks in their system and with their bank, they’ll be able to locate the refund and give you further info.\n\n* Pro tip: In case the merchant has **reversed** the payment (meaning they just return your transfer back to you), then it’s possible that the refund got stuck with the other bank. In such case, to have the refund processed, simply request an [in-app refund](https://together.bunq.com/d/47826-how-to-request-an-in-app-refund) and the funds should arrive in your account. If this doesn’t help, keep on reading \n\n## The merchant claims that the refund is in bunq’s system, what’s next? \n\nIn this case you can either: \n\n- Request in-app payment investigation and provide all the info given to you from the merchant \n- Request a refund through the app in order for us to investigate further on our side\n\nIn both cases, our relevant department will take a further look at the case, liaise with all relevant parties and keep you in the loop with the status of your refund. Once your refund is back with you, you’ll be notified right away. \n\n## Related topics: \n\n- [How to request an in-app refund](https://together.bunq.com/d/47826)\n- [How do I know if I received the refund?](https://together.bunq.com/d/49938-how-do-i-know-if-i-received-the-refund)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "What’s MassInterest and how does it work?\n\nHey bunqers \n\nAt bunq, we value freedom of choice. Taking your feedback into account, we want to give you both financial freedom and the highest possible interest rate.\nTo satisfy both needs, we're excited to introduce Freedom of Choice and bunq MassInterest. \n\nBy using Freedom of Choice you can decide what happens with your money, while MassInterest shares the returns with you! Further information on Freedom of Choice can be found [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/8682).\n\n### What’s bunq’s MassInterest? \n\n#### Personal Accounts\n\n- For  Dutch,  Irish and  Spanish residents: 2.46%\n- For  New German users, who signed up before October 19: 2.55% for the first 4 months, afterwards: 1.56%\n- For  New German users, who signed up on/after October 19: 3.85% for the first 4 months, afterwards: 1.56%\n- For  Rest of the EEA residents: 1.56%\n- For  USD and  GBP Savings Accounts: 3.71%\n\n#### Business Accounts\n\n- For  All EEA residents: 1.05%\n- For  USD and  GBP Savings Accounts: 2.3%\n\nFurther information can be found [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/57095). \n\n## How does MassInterest work? \n\nbunq MassInterest is applicable up to €100.000 / $100,000 / £100,000 for Easy Savings, Easy Bank, Easy Money and Easy Green users and applies to all Savings Accounts. Also keep in mind: \n\n* There’s no penalty or negative interest for amounts above €100.000 / $100,000 / £100.000. However, you won’t earn interest on deposits above the maximum cap. Thus, if you have €200.000 / $200,000 / £200.000 in your Savings Account, you’ll receive an interest rate as if you have €100.000 / $100,000 / £100.000. The limit applies to each currency individually. Thus, if you have €100.000 in your Euro Savings Account, you can still earn interest in your Multi-currency Savings Accounts and the other way around.\n* Euro Savings Accounts are always covered up to €100.000 by the [Deposit Guarantee Scheme](https://www.bunq.com/benefits/deposit-protection), no matter what. However, this doesn’t apply to non-Euro Savings Accounts, because the deposits are held by Currencycloud.\n* MassInterest is also applicable for all Savings Accounts owned by [minors](https://together.bunq.com/d/2961-how-do-i-open-an-account-for-my-child/6)!\n* Funds can be withdrawn 2 times per calendar month per currency. \n\n##### Want to see how MassInterest applies to you? \n\n* [What MassInterest rate applies to me?](https://together.bunq.com/d/57041) \n* [Why am I not receiving MassInterest?](https://together.bunq.com/d/57043)\n* [How is my MassInterest calculated and paid out?](https://together.bunq.com/d/57042)\n\n## How can I see my total MassInterest earnings?\n\nYou can easily review your total MassInterest earnings by following the steps below:\n\n1. Go to  Home\n2. Tap on your Savings Account\n3. Tap on the Interest Rate bubble on the left\n\n## What if I don’t want to receive MassInterest?\n\nIf you don’t want to receive MassInterest on your account, you can simply disable your Payday toggle by following the steps mentioned [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/57060). Keep in mind that by disabling the Payday toggle, you’ll also stop receiving Cashback. \n\n## Reporting Interest to Tax Authorities\n\nAs a Dutch bank, we report to the Dutch tax authorities. Based on the Common Reporting Standard, the tax authorities of Member States of the European Union cooperate with each other so the Dutch tax authorities also communicate with the German tax authorities.\n\nThis however doesn't mean that you shouldn't report your earned interest in your tax reports. You should still make sure that the interest is reported correctly to the local tax authorities \n\n\n__________\n\n## Related topics \n\n* [What MassInterest rate applies to me?](https://together.bunq.com/d/57041) \n* [Why am I not receiving MassInterest?](https://together.bunq.com/d/57043)\n* [How is my MassInterest calculated and paid out?](https://together.bunq.com/d/57042) \n\n\nExplore more bunq knowledge [here](https://go.bunq.com/link/knowledge) 濾\n\n",

    "source_text" : "I received a garnishment on my Dutch account \n\nHey bunqers \n\n### What's a garnishment?\n\nIf you have an outstanding debt to an individual, institution, or entity (also known as a creditor), they may obtain a court order to recover the money you owe. This process is called garnishment. The creditor or a bailiff acting on their behalf can use garnishment to retrieve the outstanding costs. Remember, we're here to help you navigate through this process if it happens.\n\n## Who can place a garnishment on my account?\n\nEach institution with the relevant court order in their favor can place a garnishment on your account. Some of the most common ones are the Tax Authority, the Unemployment Benefit Agency, and the Central Judicial Collection Agency.\n\nA bailiff can also place a garnishment on your account. Court order in favor of the creditor is needed so they can reach out to the bailiff. This court order is delivered to bunq by the bailiff. A judge can rule that the money on your account must be used to pay off your debt. bunq is obliged to comply with their request through a garnishment process. Garnishments are lifted by the bailiff only, not by bunq.\n\n## What happens if your Dutch account received a garnishment?\n\n#### Step 1. Seizure\n\nFirst, we must have received a garnishment request by the institution or the bailiff accompanied with the court order. While we’re processing the garnishment, we temporarily freeze your monetary account(s). That’s only until we transfer the funds into a special bunq intermediary account where they will be reserved for the bailiff. Once this is done, we will reactivate your monetary account(s) and you can use your bunq account as usual. We will not seize any funds that came in the account(s) after that.   \n\nWe transfer all your funds to this internal account unless the garnishment order states that there is a garnishment free feet. A garnishment free feet is the unseizable amount which is defined by law as the minimum necessary funds for living and it’s based on your family composition: \n\n- €1.661,40 for a single person,\n- €1.779,52 for a single parent, \n- €2.199,34 for a married couple without children, \n-  €2.317,54 for a married couple with children.\n\n#### Step 2. Statement\n\nOnce we seize the funds to the intermediary account, we inform the institution or the bailiff about the amount(s) available. We do that by providing them with a third-party statement which includes this information. \n\n#### Step 3. Transfer\n\nBased on the third-party statement, the institution or the bailiff will send us a letter with instructions whether and what amount of funds should be transferred to them.\n\n## Is there an administration fee for a garnishment? \n\nBy Dutch law, bunq is required to process every garnishment. For each garnishment we process, an administrative fee of  €80 is applied. \n\n## Can a bailiff ask for information about my bank account prior to a garnishment?\n\nBefore a bailiff places a garnishment on your bank account, the bailiff is allowed to ask whether you have a bunq account. This is by law, according to article 475aa Rv, we as a bank are required to answer this question.\n\n## I have another question about a garnishment placed on my account. Who do I contact? \n\nWe've shared the available details about the garnishment, including the file number and the creditor's name, in the garnishment announcement. For more specific advice and assistance, it would be best to reach out to the bailiff directly. They'll be able to provide you with more detailed information.\n\n## When will my garnishment be lifted?\n\nThe garnishment on your account will be lifted once we receive a court order stating that the garnishment proceedings have been finalized. \n\n## Why are the assets of my minor also frozen?\n\nYour kid is a minor, therefore their funds are your responsibility and included in the garnishment\n\n## How can I appeal?\n\nAs a third-party, we don't handle objections or other requests related to the garnishment. These matters are managed by the institution or the bailiff who placed the garnishment. If you have any further questions, it’ll be best to contact the bailiff about them.\n\n## I paid the bailiff from another bank, what should I do?\n\nWe're able to act based on the instructions we receive from the bailiff. If your debt has been settled through another account, the bailiff should inform us about this update. To expedite the process, you might want to confirm with your bailiff that they've contacted us. Please note that we'll need some time to process this information.\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [I received a garnishment on my German account ](https://together.bunq.com/d/51579)\n- [ I received a garnishment on my French account ](https://together.bunq.com/d/55120) \n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "Anti-Fraud Guide: Money mules - Don’t become one!\n\nHey bunqers \n\nYour safety and that of your money are our top priorities, which is why we ask you to consider the risk of third parties who might misuse your identity and your account to cover up their crimes. Here’s how to keep safe from money muling.\n\n### What is mulling?\n\nSimilarly to drug mules, banking mules are used as carriers for activities that are too risky for the fraudsters to engage in personally. This means that they’d rather use a bank account created in your name for money laundering. Unfortunately, this means the holder of the account would be liable for all of these illicit transactions.\n\nA mule allows third parties to access and use their accounts and/or agrees to make transactions upon the instruction of third parties.\n\nPlease always remember that if what they’re doing was legitimate, these people would use their own accounts! As a type of money laundering, muling is illegal and persecuted by the authorities.\n\n## How to avoid being misled into mulling?\n\nWe ask for your caution any time someone wants anything to do with your banking ️‍️. Here are 6 best practices for keeping yourself and your account safe from fraudsters:\n\n- Never agree to grant ‘favors’ related to your banking to nice strangers or even people you know by allowing them to access your accounts or making transfers on behalf of them - neither in good will nor in exchange for payment. \n- Be extra careful with generous tempting offers for jobs, loans, bonuses that promise quick hefty gain, especially received from strangers and/or via social media!\n- Never give your login credentials or personal information to anyone.\n- Watch out for fake websites - carefully inspect the links you receive before clicking - if the format, spelling, and domain name don’t match the businesses web address it claims to be from, it’s likely a scam.\n- If you’re unsure or suspect you might be targeted, contact us via our official channels [here](https://www.bunq.com/report)\n- Never post your bank or card details online or on social media, not even in a group or group chat.\n\nPlease contact our Support team [here](https://www.bunq.com/contact) or via the bunq app if you feel your account or identity is at risk, or if you have any questions regarding your account.\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- [How to recognize fraud and stay safe?](https://together.bunq.com/d/40318) \n- [What’s phishing and how to recognize it?](https://together.bunq.com/d/54498) \n- [Spoofing - The progressive ways of scamming nowadays, explained](https://together.bunq.com/d/45398) \n- [I was scammed.

    "source_text" : "How do I activate and deactivate my card?\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nHave you ordered a bunq card and can’t wait to start using it? Or have you temporarily lost your bunq card and want to disable it until you find it once again? \n\nYou can easily activate and deactivate your card from your bunq app. You can see the steps to do this below.\n\n### Activating your card\n\n1. Go to **Home** and tap on **Cards**.\n2. Select the card.\n3. Tap on  **Activate Card**\n4. Choose and confirm your new PIN.\n\nThen you're all set to start using your card!\n\n**Keep in mind that:**\n- The magnetic stripe of your card comes enabled by default for the countries you've allowed in your countries list  \n- You can also activate your card by scanning the QR code on your envelope once you receive it. Scanning the code will bring you to the activation flow 彩\n\n\n---\n\n## Want to enable contactless payments?\n\n\nIn order to enable contactless payments for your card, you'll first need to make one transaction using your PIN. You can do this by:\n\n1. Inserting your card into a physical pin terminal.\n2. Entering the PIN code that you set when activating your card.\n\nAfter doing so your contactless payments will be automatically enabled. You'll have a contactless limit of €25 per transaction and €50 for all transactions combined. [This topic](https://together.bunq.com/d/4757-what-is-my-daily-limit-and-how-do-i-change-it) can give you some more info.\n\n---\n\n## Deactivating your card\n\n1. Go to **Home** and tap on **Cards**.\n2. Select the card.\n3. Tap on **Block**\n4. Select **Block Temporarily**\n\nNow your card is temporarily disabled until you wish to activate it once again. Keep in mind that this is different from [blocking a card permanently](https://together.bunq.com/d/3509-). If you block your card permanently, this is an irreversible action that can't be changed.\n\n---\n\n## Can my card get automatically blocked?\n\nDue to security reasons, your card will be automatically blocked temporarily if there are multiple failed card transactions due to insufficient balance. However, if the same card keeps experiencing more failed transactions, it'll be blocked permanently.\n\nIn case your card is only blocked temporarily, you can re-activate it by simply following the steps explained here - once you do, you'll be able to either top-up the Bank Account linked to the card in question or link the card to a Bank Account with sufficient balance.\n\n---\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [What's the difference between blocking a card temporarily and permanently](https://together.bunq.com/d/3509-whats-the-difference-between-freezing-and-blocking-a-card)\n- [How can I use my bunq card abroad?](https://together.bunq.com/d/2815-how-can-i-use-my-bunq-card-abroad/9)\n- [How do I solve a failed card payment?](https://together.bunq.com/d/24142-how-do-i-solve-a-failed-card-payment)\n\nExplore more bunq knowledge [here](https://go.bunq.com/link/knowledge) ",

The Waiting List is a queue where all users who weren’t able to get verified in the promised time frame can wait until we can offer them a 5-minute verification.\n\n## How does it work? \n\nWhen you go through the signup steps and finish the verification process, our relevant department reviews the info you’ve provided and verifies your account. However, if we’re not able to verify you in 5 minutes (due to missing information or needed further elaboration), we’ll ask if you want to join the Waiting List. \n\n- If you join the Waiting List, we’ll update you immediately once we’re able to verify you in 5 minutes as promised \n\n- If you don’t want to join the Waiting List, you can simply decline our offer and close your account right away.\n\n## But why is there a Waiting List?\n\nIn the specific cases when your verification may take more time, we’d like to make sure that you’re up to date on your verification status. \n\n## I want to verify my account in 5 minutes. What should I do?\n\nThat’s an easy question! All you need to do is to follow our tips on how to quickly verify your account [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/46776)! They’re pretty simple. Take a look and you may not see the Waiting List at all! \n\n**Note:** If the verification of your Personal or Business account takes longer than 1 week, we’re going to give you an additional 30 days free trial as a gift.\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [My verification is taking longer than 5 min, what do I do now?](https://together.bunq.com/d/51084)\n- [How long does it take to verify my paperwork?](https://together.bunq.com/d/33613)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "Anti-Fraud Guide: What’s phishing and how to recognize it?\n\nHey bunqers \n\nSocial engineering scams such as phishing have been developing and improving vigorously in recent years. That’s why we’d like to explain how you can easily recognise this type of fraud and keep your account secure.\n\n**Important Note:** Always be careful with your personal data and make sure to never share it with third parties. bunq would never contact you outside of the bunq app or its official channels and ask for your credentials or any personal information (phone number, email address, security code, card number, IBAN, etc.)\n\n**Need to report a phishing incident to bunq?** Fill out our [Phishing form](https://www.bunq.com/report) to report your incident and help us fight fraud!\n\n\n### What’s phishing?\n\nPhishing is a form of fraud where the scammer tries to impersonate reputable companies contacting you by emails, texts, social media, phone calls, etc. The purpose of this is to trick you into sharing your personal details such as passwords, account details, and card numbers in order to gain access to your funds.\n\n## How can I avoid being phished? ‍♂️\n\n- Never give away your login credentials or personal information\n  - bunq will never ask users to provide login or personal information outside of the app. If someone pretending to be us is asking for this information, it is a scam and you shouldn't give any information.\n\n- Check the format and spelling in messages\n  - Fraudsters often go to great lengths to make their fake sources appear credible by copying the format and communication methods utilized by legitimate companies. Those fraudulent sources often contain spelling mistakes.\n\n- Watch out for fake websites\n  - The only bunq website where you have to enter your login credentials is [https://web.bunq.com/](https://web.bunq.com/.). Always make sure you’re on this website if you need to provide sensitive information of this kind. \n\n- Contact us via our official channels\n  - If you receive an email from a source you recognize (like bunq) but it appears slightly off or suspicious, contact us to confirm that it’s authentic. This also helps us to identify new scams.\n\n- Be careful with your posts on social media\n  - When posting on social media, be careful with your personal information like your date of birth, vacation plans, address, phone number etc. This information can be used by criminals in an attempt to scam you.\n\n- Check the URLs of the links you click on\n  - It’s always better to check and verify the link (especially in hyperlinked texts) that it indeed includes the legitimate domain name of the website you’re about to access. If in doubt, spend an extra 10 seconds to manually go to the desired page via the official website.\n\n## How can I recognize a Phishing attempt?\n\nPhishing can take a lot of different forms. Fraudsters can email you, send you a text message (SMS or other means) and even call you pretending to be bunq in order to trick you into giving away personal details that will help them gain access to our account. They will insinuate a situation of urgency such as an unrecognized device detected on your account, change of personal details information, something wrong is going on with your account and you need to verify it, etc. A link ‘for your convenience’ is provided and the moment you follow it and input any personal details (username, password, IBAN, etc.), they already got what they needed - THE ACCESS. You may also receive an SMS, an email or a phone call from a company telling you that you need to pay a certain ‘fee’ but require your credentials in order to proceed.\n\nOur domain name is bunq.com. Every link which is different from https://www.bunq.com/ or https://together.bunq.com/ claiming to be a source of information is fraudulent. If you don’t see it in the URL address of the webpage, this means that link is not managed by bunq. Any variations such as bunq.xxx.com, a.id/abcd-bunq or abcd.buzz/bunq are all fake. If you come across such links, please report them [here](https://www.bunq.com/report) using our Phishing report form. \n\nHere are examples of what a fake email messages,  SMS or website look like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n**Important:** Fraudsters can misuse online tools to fake our name in the sender field of their SMS/text, therefore your smartphone may automatically insert fraudulent messages in the same thread as legitimate messages you’ve previously received from us.\n\nDon't block our number, even if you've received the phishing SMS from there. This way we won't be able to actually send you messages which will help you to finish your verification or do other matters through the app\n\n## What will happen after you submit the report?\n\nOur dedicated team will be made aware of your report and will take immediate actions to take these websites and links down. Once a hacked account is reported, we'll act quickly to help you get back into your account. However, this only applies to cases of hacked accounts, not phishing websites.  We’ve already reported the scams to our relevant teams and the operational teams of the most widely used web browsers. They’re ensuring that all phishing websites are taken down and any funds lost by victims are returned.\n\n## How to keep your bunq account extra secured?\n\nThe ways to keep your account secure are plenty and most rely on your own vigilance and responsibility towards your personal information\n\nYou can do these every once in a while:\n\n - **Change your login code:** go to Security to change your login code.\n- **Check Devices:** go to Security and tap on \"Devices\". From there, delete any device that you don't recognize.\n- **Check your aliases:** go to Profile and tap on your name. From there, delete any phone number or email address that you don't recognize.\n\nAdditionally, we have some cool features that can help you extra secure your account. For example:\n\n- **Automatically logout when closing the bunq app:** You can adjust your Auto Logout to ensure that you're always logged out as soon as you leave the bunq app. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:\n 1. Go to  Profile\n 2. Click on ⚙️ Setting in the top right corner\n 3. Tap on Security\n 4. Tap on Auto Logout\n 5. Tap on Stay logged in for\n 6. Choose 0 seconds\n \n- **Rotating CVC:** You can set your CVC to be automatically generated for extra security. To do so, follow the steps below:\n 1. Go to  Home \n 2. Select Cards\n 3. Select the card \n 4. The info will be shown on the screen \n\n## Received an email and not sure if it’s phishing?\n\nIf you've received an email and you're not sure if it's phishing, check out the actual domains we use to communicate with you through email:\n\n- @ bunq.com - This is our primary domain and is used for transactional emails.\n- @ update.bunq.com - This subdomain is dedicated to sending bunq Update invites and general announcements.\n- @ hello.bunq.com - This sub-domain is used for marketing communications.\n- review@bunq.com - This email is used when we require extensive information and request additional documents from you.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [Spoofing - The progressive ways of scamming nowadays, explained](https://together.bunq.com/d/45398)  \n- [How to recognize fraud and stay safe?](https://together.bunq.com/d/40318) \n- [How do I log out?](https://together.bunq.com/d/27057) \n- [I was scammed.

    "source_text" : "What happens with my invested funds?\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nBased on your risk appetite, Birdee invests your money into one of their different portfolios\n\nWhen you add money to your Easy Investments account, they're transferred out of your bunq account to be invested in assets via Birdee. However, they will still be visible in the app so you can keep track of your investments \n\nWhen you withdraw funds from your Easy Investments account, the opposite happens. Your investments are sold in the marketplace, and the return is transferred back into your bunq account. For this reason, deposits and withdrawals aren't immediate and take some time to be fully processed.\n\n### Deposit and withdrawal \n\n- Your first deposit must be of €50.00 or more. Afterwards, you can deposit anything up from €10.00.\n- If you withdraw from the Easy Investments account and the remaining balance  is less than €50.00, you'll have to withdraw all funds. In other words, you must have at least €50.00 in the account, unless you take out all the funds.\n- When you withdraw funds, your investments are sold in the marketplace. There may be slight fluctuations in the value of your assets when they're actually sold, meaning the final amount that's returned can be slightly lower than the amount you see when you withdraw all.\n- If you withdraw, it’ll take a few days for the money to arrive due to processing time.\n\n## How long do investment deposits take to be processed?\nYour first investment deposit may take up to **4 business days** to complete, but following deposits will take less time to process. If you've made a deposit in the last 2 business days, you'll see Deposit in progress in your app.\n\n## How do I adjust my deposit?\n\nYou invest a certain amount on a monthly basis directly from one of your Bank Accounts to the investments account. On a monthly basis you get a scheduled payment, this is the action through which you invest in your investments account. You can alter this amount by following the steps below:\n1. Go to Home\n2. Select the Bank Account via which you invest\n3. Go to Settings, then **Scheduled payments**\n4. Find the payment scheduled for your investment account \n5. Tap the little pencil ✏️  on the top to edit the amount\n\n\n## Questions about investing?\n\nWe're ready to help you get up and running! However, bunq can't give any investment advice and isn't legally allowed to answer specific question relating to Easy Investments. Therefore in such cases we'll refer you to Birdee! Also, keep in mind that the questions in the app are asked by Birdee, not by bunq - if you have further questions, please check the [Birdee FAQ](http://help.birdee.co/en/articles/5179663-what-is-discretionary-management)\n\n## More questions regarding Easy Investments?\nCheck the [Easy Investments FAQ](https://together.bunq.com/d/47562), your answer should be there \n\n## Related topics \n\n- [What are the Easy Investments account fees?](https://together.bunq.com/d/50207)\n- [Easy Investments FAQ ](https://together.bunq.com/d/47562)\n- [Easy Investments - Invest in socially responsible companies ](https://together.bunq.com/d/47183)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "How do I request a standard bank statement?\n\nHey bunqers  \n\nTime for the Fiscal Year-End? No worries, we’ve got you covered! \n\n### What is a standard bank statement?\n\nA standard bank statement is a document that provides an overview of your accounts and credit facilities with your bank. This confirms who is authorized to act on behalf of the company. We use the format for standard bank statements of Nederlandse Beroepsorganisatie van Accountants (NBA). \n\n### How do I request a standard bank statement? \n\nSimply reach out to our [Support team](https://www.bunq.com/link/support) and request a standard bank statement by providing them with the following  info:\n\n- Name of accounting firm and address\n- Name of accountant and e-mail address\n- Name and email address of the person we should send a copy to\n- Preferred language (Dutch or English)\n- In the cases where the accountant is requesting the standard bank statement, please confirm that the company owner is aware of our fee (listed below)\n\n## Costs\n\nThe export of a standard bank statement costs €120. Fore more information, please check out our pricing sheet [here](https://www.bunq.com/en/pricing-sheet) \n\n## When can I receive it?\n\nAfter the request is submitted we will aim to send the standard bank statement to you and your accountant in less than 10 working days. If the bank statement isn’t sent to you by this deadline, make sure to contact us and let us know so that we can assist you further.\n__________\n\n## FAQs\n\n**Q. Can I have the balance of the Bank Account reflected on the bank statement?**\nA: Account balance information information is not listed on standard bank statements. If you wish to have a document showing your Bank Account's balance, it is best to export an annual overview report through the app. You can do so by following the steps [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/2523) \n\n**Q: My account has been created this year and the fiscal year is not over yet. Can I still receive a bank statement or do I have to wait for the fiscal year to be over?**\n    A: There is no need to wait!  However, you should keep in mind that the standard bank statement will _not include the complete fiscal year_. Furthermore, if another statement is requested at the end of the year, you will be charged again. Our advice (unless the statement is vital to be obtained ASAP) is to wait until the end of the fiscal year to have a complete overview \n\n**Q: I need a standard bank statement, but my account is closed / has insufficient balance. What do I do?**\nA: You can transfer the fee of €120 using the bunq.me link https://bunq.me/statement with a reference: Standard Bank statement for {Company X}. and request the standard bank statement per the above procedure. \n\n## Related topics \n\n- [How do I export a bank statement?](https://together.bunq.com/d/3207)\n- [How do I export a card statement? ](https://together.bunq.com/d/50030)\n- [How do I export my annual account overview?](https://together.bunq.com/d/2523)\n\nWant to learn more?

    "source_text" : "How are my refunds processed? 彩\n\nHey bunqers \n\nEver wondered how your refund is actually processed? This topic will give you more insights on how every type of refund works and what processes we follow before we credit back your funds \n\n### How does this work in theory?\n\nLong story short - we cooperate with the merchant and with Mastercard to process it for you. When you request your refund through the app, our relevant department reviews the request for you and assists you during the process. A detailed explanation of the process and how you participate in it can be found below. \n\nA refund request must always start in the app: it's the fastest way for you to get your money \n\n## First refund request (request in app)\n\nYou can always request a refund for any payment in the app. You can request a refund by following these steps: \n\n1. Tap on  Home\n2. Select desired Bank Account\n3. Scroll to the bottom of the screen\n4. Tap on Request a Chargeback\n5. Select the reason for this refund\n6. Submit the requested information\n7. Done \n\nMore info on how to request a successful refund [here](https://together.bunq.com/d/47826)\n\n**What happens when you request your first refund?**\n\n- If the payment was unclaimed by the merchant\n\nIn cases where the payment was unclaimed by the merchant, the payment remains open. When you request a refund for an open payment, the app starts an automatic counter based on the legal requirements for the refunding timeframe. It’s good to keep in mind that most hotels and car rental companies have a 30-day waiting period. However, in most other cases, the period is 7 days. Once the counter is over - your funds bounce back to your Bank Account right away \n\n- If the payment was claimed by the merchant \n\nIf the funds were claimed by the merchant, the refund request will be denied. But don’t worry - then you can start another refund request which will be counted as a Chargeback.\n\n## Second refund request (Chargeback)\n\nIf the first refund request was denied by the merchant, then you can request a refund again (by following the steps explained above) which will now be considered a chargeback. \n\nIn case of a chargeback process, there are some additional details which are good to know:\n\n- Please give the merchant 7 business days to respond to your refund request.\n- Have your goods not arrived? Please give the merchant 30 days to deliver your goods.\n- Did the merchant agree to refund you? Please give the merchant at least 15 business days to process the refund.\n- Are you requesting a refund for ordered goods or services? Please upload a detailed description of the goods or service (preferably an order confirmation) in the refund request.\n- Did you have any communication with the merchant? Please upload screenshots of this in the refund request.\n- If you want to request a chargeback, make sure to do so no longer than 120 days after the payment was done. \n- Remember to always request the ARN ID of the refund from the merchant, so that we can locate the potential refund and assist you further.\n- A quick summary of the overall timeframe: up to 30 business days (up to 15 business days waiting time for merchant response and 15 days for refund processing).\n\nOnce you’ve followed the instructions above, you can start the chargeback process successfully. \n\n**What happens when you request your second (chargeback) refund?**\n\nOnce Mastercard has contacted the merchant and saw both sides of the case, they decide to either cancel or proceed with the refund. \n\nWe’ll update you every step of the way.\n\n**Important note:** The investigation may take between 2 to 6 months in total due to the regulated timeframes for merchant response/further investigation. \n\n__________\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [Everything about refunds](https://together.bunq.com/d/27036)\n- [How to request an in-app refund?](https://together.bunq.com/d/47826)\n- [When can I request a refund and what do I need to do?](https://together.bunq.com/d/49933)\n\nWant to learn more?

You will also be able to see a dashboard with all the payments you selected, which ones have been notified and which ones you need to change yourself. \nOnce all the payment partners have been notified, you will receive a second email with some documentation and a reminder to log in and check the status of the partners. \n\nThis means that: \n\n- All payment partners and all direct debits made from your other bank account will be notified to change to your bunq account. \n- Once a new direct debit has been made with a company, we will automatically provide them with your bunq IBAN. Then the company will replace the IBAN on file and all future payments will be directly sent to your bunq IBAN. All direct debits made to the old account will not be processed. \n\nIf you wish to cancel your Switch Service after it has already been accepted, please contact us via [Support](https://go.bunq.com/link/support). \n\nFor any further information, you can also check out our Terms & Conditions [here](https://www.bunq.com/terms).\n\n## Related topics \n\n- [German IBANs: Hello Germany!](https://together.bunq.com/d/43452)\n- [Dutch Switch Service now available for Join Accounts](https://together.bunq.com/d/12089)\n\nWant to learn more?
